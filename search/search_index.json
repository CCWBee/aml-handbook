The continuing ability of Jersey's finance industry to attract legitimate customers with funds and assets that are clean and untainted by criminality depends, in large part, upon the Island's reputation as a sound, well-regulated jurisdiction. Any business that assists in money laundering, the financing of terrorism, or the financing of proliferation, whether:</p> <ul> <li>with knowledge or suspicion of the connection to crime; or</li> <li>acting without regard to what it may be facilitating through the provision of its products or services;</li> <li>will face the loss of its reputation, risk the loss of its Licence or other regulatory sanctions (where regulated and supervised), damage the integrity of Jersey's finance industry, and may risk prosecution for criminal offences.</li> </ul> <p>2. Jersey has had in place a framework of AML legislation since 1988, and for the CFT since 1990. This legislation has continued to be updated as new threats have emerged, including legislation to extend the definition of criminal conduct for which a money laundering offence can be committed and to combat international terrorism.</p> <p>3. Criminals are aware the AML/CFT/CPF measures taken by the traditional financial sector over the past decade and may seek other means to convert their proceeds of crime, or to mix them with legitimate income before they enter the banking system, thus making them harder to detect. Lawyers, Trust Company Businesses and providers of accountancy services have all been used as a conduit for criminal property to enter the financial system and are sometimes referred to as 'gatekeepers'. Some have also been used to assist terrorists and proliferators of weapons of mass destruction to plan and finance their operations.</p> <p>4. For example, criminals may try to exploit the services offered by Lawyers, through the business of undertaking property and financial transactions, setting up corporate and trust structures and when acting as directors or trustees. In addition, client accounts can provide a money launderer with a route into the banking system.</p> <p>5. The result has been that international AML/CFT/CPF legislation and standards have been extended beyond the traditional financial sector to all supervised businesses. This Handbook applies to all supervised persons (throughout this Handbook, where provisions of the Money Laundering Order are quoted, paraphrased, or summarised, the text refers to a relevant person to match the language of the Money Laundering Order ).</p> <p>6. Jersey's defences against money laundering, the financing of terrorism, and financing of proliferation rely heavily on the vigilance and co-operation of the finance sector. The Money Laundering Order is therefore also in place covering supervised persons.</p> <p>7. The primary legislation is defined in the Glossary of this Handbook as the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Legislation.</p> <p>8. The international standards require that all Financial Institutions, DNFBPs and VASPs must be supervised on a risk-based approach by an appropriate AML supervisory body. Within Jersey, the JFSC has been designated as the relevant supervisory body under the Supervisory Bodies Law. The JFSC is the AML/CFT/CPF supervisor for all supervised persons. Ensuring compliance and acting against those that do not comply with the measures to guard against money laundering, the financing of terrorism, and the financing of proliferation, is crucial to the effectiveness of Jersey's preventative regime.</p> <p>9. Supervised persons may get a visit from the JFSC to carry out an examination. Further information related to this can be found on the JFSC ' s website. In certain circumstances, the JFSC may also serve a notice on a supervised person which would require, among other things, senior management to attend interviews and to answer questions and/or provide information and documents.</p> <p>10. Each supervised person in Jersey must recognise the role that it must play in protecting itself, and its employees, from involvement in money laundering, the financing of terrorism, and the financing of proliferation, and in protecting the Island's reputation. This relates not only to business operations within Jersey, but also operations conducted by supervised persons outside the Island.</p> <p>11. The JFSC strongly believes that the key to the prevention and detection of money laundering, the financing of terrorism, and the financing of proliferation lies in the implementation of, and strict adherence to, effective systems and controls, including sound CDD measures based on international standards. The AML/CFT/CPF Handbook therefore establishes standards which match international standards issued by the FATF. This Handbook also has regard to the standards promoted by the Basel Committee, IOSCO and the IAIS. The Handbook takes account of the requirements of EU legislation to counter money laundering, the financing of terrorism, and the financing of proliferation and its application of standards set by the FATF.</p> <p>12. The JFSC is also mindful of the importance of financial services being generally available to all Jersey residents and, where necessary, this Handbook incorporates measures to guard against the financial exclusion of Jersey residents from financial services and products.</p> <p>13. Throughout this Handbook, supervised persons should have regard to the defined terms set out in the Glossary of this Handbook.</p>","tags":["section-1"]},{"location":"sections/01-introduction/#11-guidelines","title":"1.1 Guidelines","text":"<p>14.

This Handbook will be reviewed on a regular basis and, where necessary following consultation, amended considering experience, changes in legislation, and the development of international standards.</p> <p>18. This Handbook is intended to be used by senior management and compliance staff in the development of a supervised person's systems and controls, and detailed policies and procedures. Each supervised person is expected to draw up its own policies and procedures based on the guidance set out in the Handbook. These policies and procedures will also help senior management and staff to comply with their own personal obligations under the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Legislation. This Handbook is not intended to be used by supervised persons as an internal procedures' manual.</p> <p>19. Supervised persons are expected to think about how they might be vulnerable to and exploited by criminals. The Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Legislation expects supervised persons to manage the risks of being used by criminals, terrorists, or proliferators of weapons of mass destruction, and to document how they are managing those risks.</p> <p>20. All supervised persons should have regard to the main sections of this Handbook (sections 1-10). Supervised persons should also refer to the sector-specific sections of this Handbook (Sections 11-18) relevant to their type of business when drawing up their policies and procedures.</p>","tags":["section-1"]},{"location":"sections/01-introduction/#13-structure-of-the-amlcftcpf-handbook","title":"1.3 Structure of the AML/CFT/CPF Handbook","text":"<p>21. This Handbook describes statutory requirements (defined below), sets out principles and detailed requirements ( AML/CFT/CPF Codes of Practice ), and presents ways of complying with statutory requirements and the AML/CFT/CPF Codes of Practice (Guidance notes ).</p> <p>22. Statutory requirements describe the statutory provisions that must be complied with by a supervised person (natural or legal) when carrying on a supervised business, in particular requirements set out in the Money Laundering Order. Some statutory requirements place obligations on individuals. Failure to follow a Statutory Requirement is a criminal offence and may also attract regulatory sanction.</p> <p>23. The AML/CFT/CPF Codes of Practice set out principles and detailed requirements for compliance with statutory requirements, failure to follow any AML/CFT/CPF Codes of Practice may attract regulatory sanction. The AML/CFT/CPF Codes of Practice comprise several individual elements:</p> <ul> <li>to be followed in the area of corporate governance which must be in place in order for a supervised person to comply with statutory requirements; and</li> <li>explain in more detail how a statutory requirement is to be complied with.</li> </ul> <p>24. Guidance notes present ways of complying with the statutory requirements and AML/CFT/CPF Codes of Practice and must always be read in conjunction with these. A supervised person may adopt other measures to those set out in the Guidance notes, including policies and procedures established by a group that it is part of, so long as it can demonstrate that such measures also achieve compliance with the statutory requirements and AML/CFT/CPF Codes of Practice. This allows a supervised person discretion as to how to apply requirements in the particular circumstances of its business, products, services, transactions, and customers. The soundly reasoned application of the provisions contained within the Guidance notes will provide a good indication that a supervised person is in compliance with the statutory requirements and AML/CFT/CPF Codes of Practice.</p> <p>25. The provisions of the statutory requirements and of the AML/CFT/CPF Codes of Practice are described using the term must, indicating that these requirements are mandatory. However, in exceptional circumstances, where strict adherence to any of the AML/CFT/CPF Codes of Practice would produce an anomalous result, a supervised person may apply in advance in writing to the JFSC for a variance from the requirement. Section 1.8 of this Handbook also explains that an obligation to do something outside Jersey may be met through applying measures that are at least equivalent to the AML/CFT/CPF Codes of Practice.</p> <p>26. In contrast, the Guidance notes use the term may, indicating ways in which the requirements may be satisfied, but allowing for alternative means of meeting the statutory requirements or AML/CFT/CPF Codes of Practice.</p> <p>27. This Handbook also contains Overview text which provides context relevant to particular sections or sub-sections of the AML/CFT/CPF Handbook.</p> <p>28. This Handbook is not intended to provide an exhaustive list of systems and controls to counter money laundering, the financing of terrorism, and the financing of proliferation. In complying with the statutory requirements and AML/CFT/CPF Codes of Practice, and in applying the Guidance notes, a supervised person should (where permitted) adopt an appropriate risk-based approach and should always consider what additional measures might be necessary to prevent its exploitation, and that of its products and services, by persons seeking to engage in money laundering, the financing of terrorism, and the financing of proliferation.</p> <p>29. The text in statutory requirements sections necessarily paraphrases provisions contained in the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Legislation and should always be read and understood in conjunction with the full text of each law.

The Money Laundering Order is made by the Minister for External Relations and Financial Services under Article 37(1)(a) of the Proceeds of Crime Law. The Money Laundering Order prescribes measures to be taken (including measures not to be taken) by a relevant person for the purposes of preventing and detecting money laundering, the financing of terrorism and proliferation financing.</p> <p>34. Article 37 (1) (b) of the Proceeds of Crime Law provides, where applicable, for a relevant person to appoint persons or categories of persons for the purpose of fulfilling the obligations of the relevant person (see section 18 of this Handbook ).</p> <p>35. Failure to comply with the Money Laundering Order is a criminal offence under Article 37(4) of the Proceeds of Crime Law. In determining whether a supervised person has complied with any of the requirements of the Money Laundering Order, the Royal Court is, pursuant to Article 37(8) of the Proceeds of Crime Law, required to take account of the AML/CFT/CPF Codes of Practice and Guidance notes issued by the JFSC, as amended from time-to-time.</p> <p>36.

Under Article 35A of the Proceeds of Crime Law, a financial services business commits an offence if a person is engaged in money laundering when acting in the capacity of a person associated with that business (as defined in Article 35A(4) of the Proceeds of Crime Law ).</p> <p>39. If the financial services business is a body corporate, it is liable to a fine.

In determining whether a person has committed an offence under Article 21 of the Terrorism Law (the offence of failing to report), the Royal Court is, pursuant to Article 21(6) of the Terrorism Law, required to take account of the of any guidance provided (for this purpose guidance will include the AML/CFT/CPF Codes of Practice read in conjunction with the Overview text and the Guidance notes ), as amended from time-to-time. The sanction for failing to comply with Article 21 of the Terrorism Law may be an unlimited fine or up to five years imprisonment, or both.</p> <p>41. It should be emphasised that this Handbook is not a substitute for the law and compliance with it is not of itself a defence to offences under the various legislation referenced above. However, the Handbook shall be considered by the courts when considering the standards of a supervised person's conduct and whether they acted reasonably, honestly, and appropriately, and took all reasonable steps and exercised necessary due diligence to avoid committing the offence.</p> <p>42. Under Article 21A of the Commission Law the JFSC may impose a civil financial penalty on a supervised person (except where that person is a fund) where the JFSC is satisfied that the supervised person has, to a significant and material extent, contravened the Money Laundering Order.</p> <p>43. Article 21A of the Commission Law also permits the JFSC to impose a civil financial penalty on a principal person, a key person or a person who performs or performed a senior management function (all as defined in Article 1 of the Commission Law ) where the JFSC is satisfied that the contravention of the Money Laundering Order by the supervised person was:</p> <ul> <li>committed with the consent or connivance of, or is attributable to neglect on the part of, the principal person, key person or the person who performs or performed a senior management function; or</li> <li>aided, abetted, counselled, or procured by such a person.</li> </ul> <p>44. The JFSC has published a notice designating 'senior management functions' on its website effective from 13 March 2023.</p> <p>AML/CFT/CPF Code of Practice</p> <p>45. An AML/CFT/CPF Code of Practice is prepared and issued by the JFSC under Article 22 of the Supervisory Bodies Law. The AML/CFT/CPF Codes of Practice set out the principles and detailed requirements that must be complied with to meet certain statutory provisions of the Supervisory Bodies Law and the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Legislation (Proceeds of Crime Law, Terrorism Law, Directions Law, Targeted Financial Sanctions Measures, Wire Transfers Regulations, and the Money Laundering Order) by supervised persons. The AML/CFT/CPF Codes of Practice comprise several individual AML/CFT/CPF Codes of Practice.</p> <p>46. Article 5 of the Supervisory Bodies Law states that the JFSC shall be the supervisory body to exercise supervisory functions in respect of a regulated person ( as defined Article 1 of the Supervisory Bodies Law). The JFSC is also designated under Article 6 of the Supervisory Bodies Law to exercise supervisory functions in respect of any other person carrying on a supervised business. The effect of these provisions is to give the JFSC supervisory functions in respect of all supervised persons.</p> <p>47. Article 8A of the Supervisory Bodies Law requires a supervisory body (i.e., the JFSC ) to use a risk-based approach when performing its obligations under said law, which means determining the scrutiny that a supervised person requires based on:</p> <ul> <li>the money laundering and terrorist financing risks associated with the supervised person, as identified by the supervisory body's assessment of the supervised person's risk profile;</li> <li>the policies, internal controls and procedures associated with the supervised person, as identified by the supervisory body's assessment of the supervised person's risk profile;</li> <li>the money laundering or terrorist financing risks present in the jurisdiction in which the supervised person is based;</li> <li>any other characteristic of the supervised person that the supervisory body reasonably considers to be relevant.</li> </ul> <p>48. Article 8A(3) of the Supervisory Bodies Law requires the supervisory body (i.e. the JFSC ) to take account of FATF Recommendations when devising a risk profile for a supervised person.</p> <p>49. Compliance with the AML/CFT/CPF Codes of Practice will be considered by the JFSC in the conduct of its supervisory programme, including on-site examinations.</p> <p>50. The consequences of non-compliance with any AML/CFT/CPF Codes of Practice could include an investigation by or on behalf of the JFSC and the imposition of regulatory sanctions. Regulatory sanctions available to the JFSC under the Supervisory Bodies Law and the Regulatory Laws (where applicable) include:</p> <ul> <li>issuing a public statement;</li> <li>imposing a registration condition;</li> <li>objecting to the appointment, or continued appointment, of a principal person (or equivalent controller or manager of a regulated person ) or key person;</li> <li>imposing a direction and making this public, including preventing an individual from working in a supervised person and where already appointed requiring their removal; and</li> <li>revoking a supervised person's registration.</li> </ul> <p>51. In addition, under Article 21A of the Commission Law the JFSC may impose a civil financial penalty on a supervised person (except where that person is a fund) where the JFSC is satisfied that the supervised person has, to a significant and material extent, contravened an AML/CFT/CPF Code of Practice.</p> <p>52. Article 21A of the Commission Law also permits the JFSC to impose a civil financial penalty on a principal person, a key person or a person who performs or performed a senior management function (all as defined in Article 1 of the Commission Law ) where the JFSC is satisfied that the contravention of the AML/CFT/CPF Code of Practice by the supervised person was:</p> <ul> <li>committed with the consent or connivance of, or is attributable to neglect on the part of, the principal person, key person or the person who performs or performed a senior management function; or</li> <li>aided, abetted, counselled, or procured by such a person.</li> </ul> <p>53. The JFSC has published a notice designating 'senior management functions' on its website effective from 13 March 2023.</p> <p>54. The ability of a supervised person to demonstrate compliance with AML/CFT/CPF Codes of Practice will also be directly relevant to its regulated status and any assessment of fitness and propriety of its principal persons and key persons. Non-compliance with any AML/CFT/CPF Code of Practice may be regarded by the JFSC as an indication of:</p> <ul> <li>a lack of fitness and propriety under Articles 7 or 8B of the CIF(J) Law, Article 10 of the BB(J) Law, Article 7 of the IB(J) Law, and Article 9 of the FS(J) Law; and/or</li> <li>a failure to follow certain fundamental principles within a Code of Practice issued under each of the Regulatory Laws.</li> </ul> <p>55. Where a breach of an AML/CFT/CPF Code of Practice results in contravention of the Money Laundering Order, a supervised person and its employees can be criminally prosecuted.</p> <p>AML/CFT/CPF Code of Practice</p> <p>56. By virtue of the definition of relevant person in Article 1(1), the Money Laundering Order applies to any supervised person who is carrying on a supervised business in or from within Jersey. This will include Jersey-based branches of companies incorporated outside Jersey conducting supervised business in Jersey.</p> <p>57. A distinction should be made between a Schedule 2 business and a Prescribed NPO. Although both are supervised persons, Prescribed NPOs are not Schedule 2 businesses, and therefore are not subject to the requirements of the Money Laundering Order.</p> <p>58. By virtue of Articles 5, 6 and 22 of the Supervisory Bodies Law, the AML/CFT/CPF Codes of Practice apply to any supervised person who is carrying on a supervised business in or from within Jersey. This will include Jersey-based branches of companies incorporated outside Jersey conducting supervised business in Jersey.</p> <p>59. The AML/CFT/CPF Codes of Practice in Sections 2 to 10 of this Handbook must be complied with by all supervised persons. The sector-specific sections within this Handbook only provide additional AML/CFT/CPF Codes of Practice for particular business types in very limited circumstances.</p>","tags":["section-1"]},{"location":"sections/01-introduction/#152-application-of-the-money-laundering-order-to-supervised-persons-carrying-on-business-outside-jersey-overseas","title":"1.5.2 Application of the Money Laundering Order to supervised persons carrying on business outside Jersey (overseas)","text":"<p>60. Article 10A of the Money Laundering Order explains and regulates the application of the Money Laundering Order to supervised business carried on outside Jersey.</p> <p>61. Article 10A(2)(a) of the Money Laundering Order explains that a Jersey body corporate or other legal person registered in Jersey ( supervised person ) that carries on a supervised business through an overseas branch must comply with the Money Laundering Order in respect of that business, irrespective of whether it also carries on supervised business in or from within Jersey.</p> <p>62. However, Article 10A(9) of the Money Laundering Order explains that a supervised person carrying on any of the business activities described in paragraphs 18 to 22 of Part 3 of Schedule 2 to the Proceeds of Crime Law need not comply with paragraphs (2), (3) and (4) in a country or territory outside Jersey in respect of their supervised business.</p> <p>63. Notwithstanding the above paragraph, all the provisions of the Money Laundering Order apply to a supervised person that is a legal person carrying on supervised business anywhere in the world. However, in practice this may not apply to all supervised persons carrying on supervised business on the basis that some businesses currently registered under the Supervisory Bodies Law are either sole practitioners or Jersey customary law partnerships.</p> <p>64. Article 10A(3) of the Money Laundering Order requires a supervised person (subject to Article 10A(9), see above) who: (i) is registered, incorporated or otherwise established under Jersey law, but who is not a legal person; and (ii) carries on a supervised business in or from within Jersey, to apply measures that are at least equivalent to the requirements of the Money Laundering Order in respect of any supervised business carried on by that person through an overseas branch. This requirement will apply to a limited partnerships registered under the Limited Partnerships (Jersey) Law 1994 and general partnership established under Jersey customary law.</p> <p>Note that the term 'registered, incorporated or otherwise established' in Article 10A(5) of the Money Laundering Order is intended to be understood only to refer to the creation of a legal arrangement. In particular, it is not intended that 'registered' be understood in the more general sense of registering under commercial or other legislation, or that 'established' be understood in the more general sense of establishing a branch or representative office.</p> <p>65. Article 10A(2)(b) of the Money Laundering Order requires a Jersey body corporate or other legal person ( supervised person ) registered in Jersey (subject to Article 10A(9) of the Money Laundering Order, see above) to ensure that any legal person that is majority owned or controlled by that person (referred to in the Money Laundering Order as a 'subsidiary') applies measures that are at least equivalent to the requirements of the Money Laundering Order in respect of any supervised business carried on outside Jersey by that subsidiary.</p> <p>66. Article 10A(4) of the Money Laundering Order requires a supervised person (subject to Article 10A(9) of the Money Laundering Order, see above) who: (i) is registered, incorporated or otherwise established under Jersey law, but who is not a legal person; and (ii) carries on a supervised business in or from within Jersey, to ensure that any subsidiary applies measures that are at least equivalent to the requirements of the Money Laundering Order in respect of any supervised business carried on outside Jersey by that subsidiary. This requirement will apply to a limited partnership registered under the Limited Partnerships (Jersey) Law 1994 and general partnership established under Jersey customary law.</p> <p>67. In summary, Jersey companies and other legal persons registered in Jersey (subject to Article 10A(9) of the Money Laundering Order, see above) are covered by Article 10A(2) of the Money Laundering Order in relation to their overseas branches and subsidiaries.

Article 10A(6) of the Money Laundering Order requires a supervised person (subject to Article 10A(9) of the Money Laundering Order, see above) to take reasonable steps to comply with paragraphs (2), (3) and (4) to the extent that the law of the country or territory in which that person carries on a supervised business, or has a subsidiary carrying on such a business, does not have the effect of prohibiting or preventing the supervised person from taking such steps. If the supervised person does not comply with paragraphs (2), (3) and (4), the following steps must be taken by the supervised person: (i) the JFSC must be informed that this is the case; (ii) other reasonable steps to deal effectively with the risk of money laundering and the financing of terrorism or proliferation financing must be taken.</p> <p>69. If a supervised person carries on a supervised business or has a subsidiary carrying on such a business overseas that has more stringent requirements than those set out in the Money Laundering Order, Article 10A(10) of the Money Laundering Order requires that the supervised person ensure that the more stringent requirements are complied with.</p> <p>AML/CFT/CPF Code of Practice</p> <p>70. By virtue of Articles 5, 6 and 22 of the Supervisory Bodies Law, a supervised person (subject to Article 10A(9) of the Money Laundering Order, see above) that is a company incorporated in Jersey that carries on a supervised business through an overseas branch must comply with the AML/CFT/CPF Codes of Practice in respect of that business, irrespective of whether it also carries on supervised business in or from within Jersey.</p> <p>71. By concession, measures that are at least equivalent to AML/CFT/CPF Codes of Practice may be applied as an alternative to complying with the AML/CFT/CPF Codes of Practice.</p> <p>72. A supervised person (subject to Article 10A(9) of the Money Laundering Order, see above) who (i) is registered, incorporated or otherwise established under Jersey law, but who is not a Jersey incorporated company; and (ii) carries on a supervised business in or from within Jersey, must apply measures that are at least equivalent to AML/CFT/CPF Codes of Practice in respect of any supervised business carried on by that person through an overseas branch. This requirement will apply to a foundation or partnership established under Jersey law.</p> <p>Note that the term 'registered, incorporated or otherwise established' is intended to be understood only to refer to the creation of a legal person or legal arrangement.</p> <p>73. A supervised person (subject to Article 10A(9) of the Money Laundering Order, see above) that is a Jersey incorporated company must ensure that any subsidiary applies measures that are at least equivalent to AML/CFT/CPF Codes of Practice in respect of any supervised business carried on outside Jersey by that subsidiary.</p> <p>74. A supervised person (subject to Article 10A(9) of the Money Laundering Order, see above) who (i) is registered, incorporated or otherwise established under Jersey law, but who is not a Jersey incorporated company; and (ii) carries on a supervised business in or from within Jersey, must ensure that any subsidiary applies measures that are at least equivalent to AML/CFT/CPF Codes of Practice in respect of any supervised business carried on outside Jersey by that subsidiary.

To assist the overall objective of detecting and preventing money laundering, the financing of terrorism, and the financing of proliferation, this Handbook adopts a risk-based approach. Such an approach:</p> <ul> <li>recognises that the money laundering, financing of terrorism, and financing of proliferation threat to a supervised person varies across customers, countries and territories, products and delivery channels;</li> <li>allows a supervised person to differentiate between customers in a way that matches risk in a particular supervised person;</li> <li> <p>while establishing minimum standards, allows a supervised person to apply its own approach to systems and controls, and arrangements in particular circumstances;</p> </li> <li> <p>helps to produce a more cost-effective system.</p> </li> </ul> <p>87. A risk-based approach requires steps to be taken to identify how a supervised person could be used for money laundering, the financing of terrorism, or the financing of proliferation and establishing the most effective and proportionate way to manage and mitigate the risks in the same way as for all business risks faced by a supervised person.</p> <p>88. The possibility of being used to assist with money laundering, the financing of terrorism, and the financing of proliferation poses many risks for supervised persons including:</p> <ul> <li>criminal and disciplinary sanctions for the supervised person and for key and principal persons;</li> <li>civil action against the supervised person as a whole and against individual staff; and</li> <li>damage to reputation leading to loss of business.</li> </ul> <p>89. Systems and controls will not detect and prevent all money laundering, terrorist financing, or proliferation financing activity. A risk-based approach will, however, serve to balance the cost burden placed on a supervised person and on its customers with a realistic assessment of the threat of it being used in connection with money laundering, the financing of terrorism, or the financing of proliferation by focusing effort where it is needed and has most impact.</p> <p>90. How a risk-based approach is applied will also depend on the structure of the supervised person's business, its size and the nature of its products and services.</p> <p>91. The policies and procedures put in place should be proportionate to the size of the business and the identified risks.</p> <p>92. Policies and procedures may be more straightforward for smaller businesses. Such businesses may offer a smaller range of products or services, with most customers falling into similar categories. In these circumstances, a simpler approach may be appropriate for most customers, with the focus being on those customers that fall outside the usual categories. Larger businesses with a small range of products or services can put standard AML/CFT/CPF policies and procedures in place based on generic profiles of customers.</p> <p>93. In more complex business relationships, risk assessment, mitigation, and ongoing monitoring will be more sophisticated and will consider additional information held and knowledge of the customer's business activities.</p> <p>94.

A supervised person must maintain appropriate policies and procedures to enable it, when requested by the JFSC, to make available to that authority a copy of its BRA.</p> <p>Guidance</p> <p>21. When considering a risk appetite for the supervised person's business, the board may wish to examine the following factors (note the below list is not exhaustive):</p> <ul> <li>are they prepared to accept only a certain proportion of business rated at each risk level? For example, the board may only have an appetite for high-risk customers to form a set proportion of their overall fee income or assets under management;</li> <li>are there any country connections or customer risk levels with which the board are not prepared to engage?</li> <li>are there any sensitive activities or industries undertaken by potential customers, which the board are not prepared to take on?</li> <li>will the board accept business relationships or one-off transactions where PEPs are involved?</li> <li>how do the characteristics of the supervised person (e.g., business sector, type of products and services offered) potentially expose it to greater ML, TF, and/or PF risk?</li> <li>what types of customers and activity are considered to be outside of Jersey's national risk appetite? See Financial crime strategy, appetite and national risk assessments (gov.je)</li> </ul> <p>22. It is important for the risk appetite to be sufficiently clear so that the board can articulate it when considering whether to establish a business relationship or carry out a one-off transaction with a customer. For example, it should not be so vague that it can be used to justify the acceptance of any business, no matter the risk level.</p> <p>23. Equally, a clear risk appetite should not be wilfully ignored. For example, a high-risk potential customer offers an attractive fee proposition, so the business is accepted even though doing so would mean the supervised person exceeds the risk appetite's stated maximum proportion of high -risk business.</p> <p>24. It is the responsibility of the board to ensure that business relationships and one-off transactions are maintained in accordance with the agreed risk appetite.</p> <p>25. A supervised person may extend its existing risk management systems to address money laundering/terrorist financing/proliferation financing risks. The detail and sophistication of these systems will depend on the supervised person's size and the complexity of the business it undertakes. Ways of incorporating a supervised person's BRA will be governed by the size of the supervised person and how regularly compliance staff and the board are involved in day-to-day activities.</p> <p>26. The board of a supervised person may demonstrate that it has considered its exposure to money laundering, the financing of terrorism, and the financing of proliferation risk by:</p> <ul> <li>involving all members of the board in determining the risks posed by money laundering, the financing of terrorism, and the financing of proliferation within those areas for which they have responsibility;</li> <li>considering organisational factors that may increase the level of exposure to the risk of money laundering, the financing of terrorism, and the financing of proliferation, e.g., outsourced aspects of regulated activities or compliance functions;</li> <li>considering the nature, scale and complexity of its business, the diversity of its operations (including geographical diversity), the volume and size of its transactions, and the degree of risk associated with each area of its operation;</li> <li>considering who its customers are and what they do, e.g., do its customers engage in higher-risk activities (having regard for the JFSC 's Sound Business Policy);</li> <li>considering whether any additional risks are posed by the countries, territories and areas with which its customers are connected. Factors such as high levels of organised crime, increased vulnerabilities to corruption and inadequate frameworks to prevent and detect money laundering, the financing of terrorism, and the financing of proliferation will impact the risk posed by relationships connected with such countries, territories and areas;</li> <li>considering the characteristics of the products and services that it offers and assessing the associated vulnerabilities posed by each product and service. For example:</li> <li>(a) products that allow a customer to 'pool' third party funds will tend to be more vulnerable - because of the anonymity provided by the co-mingling of assets or funds belonging to several third parties by the customer;</li> <li>(b) products such as standard current accounts are more vulnerable because they allow payments to be made to and from external parties, including cash transactions;</li> <li>(c) conversely, those products that do not permit external party transfers or where redemption is permitted only to an account from which the investment is funded will be less vulnerable;</li> <li> <p>(d) products and services which make use of new and developing technologies, such as virtual assets, may pose a risk due to the increased anonymity which can be afforded by the asset to their users. There may also be a lack of experience in providing these new products, meaning the control environment may not be as effective.</p> </li> <li> <p>considering the risk that is involved in placing reliance on obliged persons to apply reliance identification measures;</p> </li> <li>considering how it establishes and delivers products and services to its customers. For example, risks are likely to be greater where relationships may be established remotely (non-face-to-face), or may be controlled remotely by the customer (straight-through processing of transactions);</li> <li>a supervised person may employ new and developing technologies to establish business relationships with their customers, for example through an E-ID application. As discussed further in Section 4.3.5 of this Handbook, the risks of using such technology to obtain evidence of identity should be considered, noting the particular characteristics of each application. This should be recorded in the BRA;</li> <li>considering the accumulation of risk for more complex customers.</li> </ul> <p>27. When conducting a BRA care should be taken not to focus too much on any single factor. All factors (including those identified by a National Risk Assessment or similar), as well as the wider picture (and cumulative risk) should be considered.</p> <p>28. Care should also be taken not to rely on a 'template' BRA, i.e., one previously prepared within the business or supplied by an external provider. The assessment should be customised to fully reflect and consider the unique types of customers serviced by the business, the geographical areas to which it has exposure, and the specific products and services provided by the business.</p> <p>29. With reference to new and developing technologies, the board should have a due diligence process in place to analyse and understand their risks, then apply a framework for how they will be monitored and managed going forward.</p> <p>30. A generic example of how risk might be calculated in a BRA is set out below. Please note this methodology is for illustrational purposes only. It should not be construed as the JFSC taking a position on how risk should be calculated and represented in a BRA. Each BRA should uniquely consider and represent the risks and controls identified by the supervised person:</p> Impact (implications of event) Likelihood (of event happening) Inherent Risk (impact x likelihood) Impact and likelihood after controls applied Residual risk (impact x likelihood after controls applied) 3 - Significant impact on business. 3 - Very likely. 9 - High inherent risk. Each rating may range from 1-3. Possible scores: 1-9. 2 - Moderate impact on business. 2 - Moderately likely. 4 - Moderate inherent risk. Each rating may range from 1-3. Possible scores: 1-9. 1 - Minimal impact on business. 1 - Unlikely to happen. 1 - Low inherent risk. Each rating may range from 1-3. Possible scores: 1-9. <p>Guidance</p> <p>31. A generic example of a BRA is set out below. Please note the descriptions and scores assigned to these risks are for illustrational purposes only. They should not be construed as the JFSC taking a position on how these risks should be scored and/or controlled. Each BRA should uniquely consider and represent the risks and controls identified by the supervised person:</p> Risk descriptor Impact Likelihood Inherent Risk Controls applied Residual Risk Customer is involved in evasion of sanctions relating to financing of proliferation. 3 (Reputational damage, potential legal/regulatory sanctions). 2 6 Business will not engage with customers involved in shipping or have connections to Iran or DPRK. Reduces likelihood to 1. 3 x 1 = 3 Pandemic requiring national lockdown. 3 (Business unable to operate). 1 3 All staff able to work remotely. All customer transactions can be undertaken electronically. Reduces impact to 1. 1 x 1 = 1 Breach of Money Laundering Order. 3 (Reputational damage, potential legal/regulatory sanctions). 2 6 Staff receive training at on- boarding, and regularly thereafter. Staff are required to comply with policies and procedures. Breaches are recorded and considered at board meetings. Consideration includes trends analysis, lessons learned, training needs and strengthening controls. Reduces likelihood to 1. 3 x 1 = 3 <p>Guidance</p> <p>32. In developing a risk-based approach, supervised persons need to ensure that the BRA can be understood by the board, other relevant employees and relevant third parties, e.g., auditors and the JFSC.</p> <p>33. In the case of a supervised person that is dynamic and growing, the board may demonstrate that its BRA is kept up-to-date where it is reviewed annually. In some other cases, this may be too often, e.g., a supervised person with a stable customer base, products, and services. In all cases, the board may demonstrate that its BRA is kept up-to-date where it is reviewed when events (internal and external) occur that may materially change money laundering, terrorist financing, and proliferation financing risk.</p> <p>34. It may be beneficial for money laundering, financing of terrorism, and financing of proliferation risks and controls to each be considered separately.</p> <p>35. When reviewing a BRA, the board should ensure it captures all relevant risks and considers how effective the business' control environment is at managing those risks. Effectiveness can be evidenced by considering the findings of control testing such as periodic reviews and reviewing data collected by the supervised person.</p> <p>36. Where gaps or deficiencies are identified during a BRA review, an action plan should be drawn up so they can be addressed. The action plan should form an integral part of the BRA.</p> <p>37. Where a supervised person is subject to a regulatory Code of Practice (such as the Trust Company Business Code of Practice) there is also an obligation for a wider, operational BRA to be conducted. When preparing an AML/CFT/CPF BRA or CRA, factors in this operational BRA may be relevant. Therefore, a combined AML/CFT/CPF and operational BRA may be appropriate.</p> <p>38. Risks that are not normally considered to be specific money laundering/terrorist financing/proliferation financing risks may also be relevant to an AML/CFT/CPF BRA, for example, credit risk, tax risk, investor eligibility risk, cyber security related risk etc.</p> <p>39. It is likely that the BRA will be conducted by the supervised person prior to any CRA. When a CRA is prepared, the BRA may need to be updated (for example, to consider new risk factors, or the supervised person's changing risk tolerance/appetite).</p> <p>40. For supervised persons who are operating as an agent of another supervised person (or have agents operating on their behalf), either the supervised person or the agent should determine, relative to the nature of their relationship, how each risk is to be identified, managed, and documented. This is particularly important in the case of MVTS supervised persons, whereby each agent may have bespoke risks which will need to be carefully identified, assessed, and managed.</p>","tags":["section-2"]},{"location":"sections/02-corporate-governance/#24-adequate-and-effective-systems-and-controls","title":"2.4 Adequate and effective systems and controls","text":"<p>41.

Article 11(1) of the Money Laundering Order requires a relevant person to establish and maintain appropriate and consistent policies and procedures in respect of the person's financial services business, and financial services business carried on by a subsidiary, to prevent and detect money laundering, the financing of terrorism.</p> <p>43. Parts 3, 3A, 4 and 5 of the Money Laundering Order set out the measures that are to be applied in respect of CDD, record-keeping and reporting.</p> <p>44. Article 11(2) of the Money Laundering Order requires that policies and procedures established and maintained under Article 11(1) are appropriate and consistent having regard to the degree of risk of money laundering and the financing of terrorism taking into account: (i) the level of risk identified in a national or sector-specific risk assessment in relation to money laundering carried out in respect of Jersey; and (ii) the type of customers, business relationships, products and transactions with which the relevant person's business is concerned.</p> <p>45. Article 11(3) lists several policies and procedures that must be established and maintained.</p> <p>46. Article 11(9) of the Money Laundering Order requires a relevant person to take appropriate measures for the purpose of making employees whose duties relate to the provision of financial services ('relevant employees') aware of policies and procedures under Article 11(1) and of legislation in Jersey to counter money laundering and the financing of terrorism. Article 11(10) of the Money Laundering Order requires a relevant person to provide relevant employees with training in the recognition and handling of transactions carried out by or on behalf of persons who are, or appear to be, engaged in money laundering or the financing of terrorism.</p> <p>47. Article 11(11) of the Money Laundering Order requires a relevant person to establish and maintain policies and procedures for monitoring compliance with and testing the effectiveness of: (i) its policies and procedures; (ii) its measures to promote AML/CFT awareness; and (iii) its training of relevant employees (see Section 9 of this Handbook).</p> <p>48. When considering the type and extent of testing to be carried out under Articles 11(11) and 11(12) of the Money Laundering Order requires a relevant person to have regard to the risk of money laundering or financing of terrorism that exists in respect of the relevant person's business, and matters that have an impact on that risk, such as the size and structure of the relevant person.</p> <p>49. Article 11(8) requires that a relevant person operating through branches or subsidiaries, which carry on financial services business, must communicate its policies and procedures, maintained in accordance with Article 11(1) of the Money Laundering Order, to those branches or subsidiaries. In addition, Article 11A of the Money Laundering Order requires group programmes for information sharing (see Section 2.8 of this Handbook).</p> <p>AML/CFT/CPF Code of Practice</p> <p>50. A supervised person must establish and maintain appropriate and consistent systems and controls to prevent and detect money laundering, the financing of terrorism, and the financing of proliferation, that enable it to:</p> <ul> <li>apply the policies and procedures referred to in Article 11 of the Money Laundering Order;</li> <li>apply CDD measures -in line with Sections 3 to 7 of this Handbook;</li> <li> <p>report to the FIU when it knows, suspects, or has reasonable grounds to know or suspect that another person is involved in money laundering or the financing of terrorism, including attempted transactions -in line with Section 8 of this Handbook;</p> </li> <li> <p>adequately screen relevant employees when they are initially employed, make employees aware of certain matters and provide training -in line with Section 9 of this Handbook;</p> </li> <li>keep complete records that may be accessed on a timely basis -in line with Section 10 of this Handbook;</li> <li>liaise closely with the JFSC and the FIU on matters concerning vigilance, systems, and controls (including policies and procedures );</li> <li>communicate policies and procedures to overseas branches and subsidiaries (subject to Article 10A(9) of the Money Laundering Order (see section 1.4.2 of this Handbook ), and monitor compliance therewith; and</li> <li>monitor and review instances where exemptions are granted to policies and procedures, or where controls are overridden.</li> </ul> <p>51. In addition to those listed in Article 11(3) of the Money Laundering Order, a supervised person must have policies and procedures for:</p> <ul> <li>customer acceptance (and rejection), including approval levels for higher risk customers;</li> <li>the use of transaction limits and management approval for higher risk customers;</li> <li>placing reliance on obliged persons;</li> <li>applying exemptions from CDD requirements under Part 3A of the Money Laundering Order and enhanced CDD measures under Articles 15, and 15A of the Money Laundering Order;</li> <li>keeping documents, data or information obtained under identification measures up-to-date and relevant changes in beneficial ownership and/or control, including beneficiaries under a life insurance policy;</li> <li>taking action in response to notices highlighting countries and territories in relation to which the FATF has called for the application of countermeasures or enhanced CDD measures;</li> <li>taking action to comply with the Targeted Financial Sanctions Measures and the Directions Law.</li> </ul> <p>52.

A risk-based approach to the application of identification measures involves several discrete stages. The overall objective is to assess the most effective and proportionate way to manage the money laundering, terrorist financing, and proliferation financing risk faced by a supervised person. While these stages are required to be incorporated into policies and procedures, they do not need to take place in the sequence outlined below. They may also occur simultaneously.</p> <p>21. The risk assessment of a particular customer (i.e. the CRA ) will determine:</p> <ul> <li> <p>the extent of information which will be requested;</p> </li> <li> <p>what evidence of identity will be obtained;</p> </li> <li>the extent to which the resulting relationship will be scrutinised; and</li> <li>how often documents, data or information held will be reviewed.</li> </ul> <p>22. Section 2.3 of this Handbook requires the board (or where the supervised person is not a company, senior management) of a supervised person to conduct (and keep up-to-date) a BRA, which considers the supervised person's risk appetite, activities and structure and concludes on the supervised person's exposure to money laundering, the financing of terrorism, and the financing of proliferation risk.</p> <p>23. This BRA will enable a supervised person to determine its initial approach to performing Stage 1 of the identification process as set out below, depending on the type of customer, product or service involved. The remaining stages of the process require a supervised person to consider whether the specific circumstances of the customer will necessitate the application of further measures.</p> <p>24. Part 3A of the Money Laundering Order sets out exemptions from CDD requirements, including; circumstances in which exemptions do not apply (see Article 17A of the Money Laundering Order ); exemptions from applying other identification requirements (see Articles 17B, 17C and 18 of the Money Laundering Order ); and the obligations of a supervised person who is exempt from applying third party identification requirements (see Article 17D of the Money Laundering Order ).</p> <p>25. The following are the stages in the identification process:</p> Stage Identification measures Article(s) of the Money Laundering Order Guidance sections in the Handbook 1.1 In the case of a customer that is a legal person, a supervised person must understand the ownership and contro l structure of the customer (and provisions under which the customer can enter into contracts). 3(2)(c)(ii) Section 3.3.1 1.2 A supervised person must find out the identity of: \u203a the customer; \u203a any Beneficial owners and controllers of the customer; \u203a any third party (or parties) - including a legal arrangement - on whose behalf the customer acts. Whether directly or indirectly (and Beneficial owners and controllers of the third party (or parties)); o For the avoidance of doubt, the above will include any person who is a named beneficiary of a life assurance policy entered into by the customer. Where there is no named beneficiary and they are designated by characteristics or by class or by other means, this means obtaining sufficient information about who the beneficiaries of a life policy are, sufficient to enable an assessment of risk of the customer relationship and to enable beneficiaries to be identified and verified at the time of the pay-out and \u203a others listed in Article 3(2) of the Money Laundering Order. 3(2)(a) to (c) 3(4)(a) Section 4 1.3 A supervised person must obtain information on the purpose and intended nature of the business relationship or one-off transaction. Also note additional AML/CFT/CPF Codes of Practice requirement to understand purpose and intended nature. 3(2)(d) Sections 3.3.2 and 3.3.3 Section 7 1.4 A supervised person must obtain appropriate information for assessing the risk that a business relationship or one-off transaction will involve money laundering, the financing of terrorism, or the financing of proliferation. It may be necessary to repeat this stage following an assessment of risk under stage 2.1 below. 3(5) 15(1) Sections 3.3.2 and 3.3.3 Section 7 2.1 A supervised person must, based on information collected at stage 1 above, assess the risk that a business relationship or one-off transaction will involve money laundering, the financing of terrorism, or the financing of proliferation (risk profile). 3(5) Section 3.3.4 2.2 A supervised person must prepare and record a customer business and risk profile. 3(3)(a) Section 3.3.5 3 A supervised person must obtain evidence of the identity of those whose identity is found out at stage 1.2 above. 3(2)(a) to (c) 3(4)(b) 15(1) Section 4 Section 7 <p>26. By virtue of on-going monitoring, particularly in relation to higher risk categories of customers, under Article 3(3)(b) of the Money Laundering Order, a supervised person must keep documents, data and information obtained under Stages 1 and 3 up to date and relevant. See Section 3.4 of this Handbook.</p> <p>27. As shown in the table above, in some cases the Money Laundering Order requires supervised persons to simply obtain information. For example, finding out identity (Stage 1.2 above).</p> <p>28. However, in other cases the Money Laundering Order requires supervised persons to also understand the information they obtain. For example, the ownership and control structure of the customer (Stage 1.1 above).</p> <p>29. For each stage of the process, it is important for supervised persons to be aware of the distinction between factual information which they simply need to collect (name, address, date of birth, etc.) and that which requires further analysis (structure charts relating to ultimate beneficial ownership, publicly available adverse media, credit reports, etc.). This will assist in the identification and risk assessment process being carried out effectively.</p> <p>30. Systems and controls (including policies and procedures ) will not detect and prevent all instances of money laundering, the financing of terrorism, or the financing of proliferation. A riskbased approach will, however, serve to balance the cost burden placed on a supervised person and on customers with the risk that the business may be used in money laundering, the financing of terrorism, or the financing of proliferation by focusing resources on higher risk areas.</p> <p>31. Care has to be exercised under a risk-based approach. Being identified as carrying a higher risk of money laundering, the financing of terrorism, or the financing of proliferation does not automatically mean that a customer is a money launderer, is financing terrorism, or is financing proliferation. Similarly, identifying a customer as carrying a lower risk of money laundering, the financing of terrorism, or the financing of proliferation does not mean that the customer is not a money launderer, a terrorist financier, or finances proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.</p> <p>AML/CFT/CPF Code of Practice</p> <p>32. A supervised person must apply a risk-based approach to determine the extent and nature of the measures to be taken when undertaking the identification process set out above.</p> <p>33.

A supervised person must understand the nature and scope of the business activities generating a customer's funds/assets.</p> <p>Guidance</p> <p>35. A supervised person may demonstrate that it understands the nature and scope of a customer's business activities where it collects and considers information regarding those activities. The volume of information collected and considered should be determined on a risk-based approach and may include, but is not limited to, the following:</p> <ul> <li>the industry sectors within which the business operates. The supervised person is not required to have an expert understanding of each industry sector, rather it should be sufficient to understand the potential risk exposure of the sector to money laundering, the financing of terrorism, or the financing of proliferation;</li> <li>whether the business activities display any higher risk indicators of money laundering, the financing of terrorism, or the financing of proliferation. These include, but are not limited to, the indicators listed at paragraph 77 below;</li> <li>whether the business is a state-owned enterprise or receives any government funding;</li> <li>the geographical scope of the business activities. For example, where the business operates and what it does in those countries;</li> <li>the reputation of the customer's business. For example, using a search engine to identify if any adverse media comment has been made on the conduct of the business and its Beneficial owners and/or controllers; and</li> <li>further clarification from the customer regarding any of the above, where necessary.</li> </ul> <p>36. When undertaking the above activities, a supervised person should document their consideration (i.e., their thought-process) and record their conclusions.</p> <p>37. Where information is provided by someone other than the customer themselves, additional questions may need to be asked to assess whether it is reasonable to use this information, and consideration of the AML/CFT/CPF risk should be undertaken as part of the CRA.</p>","tags":["section-3"]},{"location":"sections/03-identification-overview/#331-understanding-ownership-structure-stage-11","title":"3.3.1 Understanding ownership structure -Stage 1.1","text":"<p>38.

A supervised person should consider whether other variables are appropriate factors to consider in the context of the products and services that it provides and its customer base.</p> <p>59. In assessing customer risk, the presence of one factor that might indicate higher risk will not automatically mean that a customer is in fact higher risk.

The sophistication of the risk assessment process may be determined according to factors supported by the BRA.</p> <p>61. Inconsistencies between information obtained may also assist in assessing risk. For example, a supervised person might identify inconsistencies between specific information concerning source of funds (or source of wealth ), and the nature of the customer's expected activity.</p> <p>62. A supervised person may demonstrate that it has assessed the risk that a business relationship or one-off transaction will involve money laundering, the financing of terrorism, or the financing of proliferation where it considers the factors set out at Section 3.3.4.1 of this Handbook.</p> <p>63.

A supervised person may demonstrate that it has assessed the risk that a business relationship or one-off transaction will involve money laundering, the financing of terrorism, or the financing of proliferation where it takes into account the effect of a combination of several factors -e.g. the use of complex structures by a customer who is a non-resident high-net-worth individual making use of wealth management services -which may increase the cumulative level of risk beyond the sum of each individual risk element. The accumulation of risk is itself a factor to consider.</p> <p>65. A supervised person may demonstrate that it has assessed the risk that a business relationship or one-off transaction will involve money laundering, the financing of terrorism, or proliferation financing where it takes into account the potential effect of the person or persons collating the CDD of the customer being a third party, e.g. they might be twice or even further removed from the supervised person.</p> <p>66. Notwithstanding the above, where it is appropriate to do so, a supervised person may demonstrate that it has assessed the risk that a business relationship or one-off transaction will involve money laundering, the financing of terrorism, or the financing of proliferation where it assesses that risk 'generically' for customers falling into similar categories.

The list of jurisdictions under increased monitoring which have committed to addressing their issues is often informally referred to as FATF's 'grey list'. Jurisdictions which do not have an action plan are placed on a list of high-risk jurisdictions subject to a call for action. This is informally known as FATF's 'black list';</li> <li>where a customer has a connection to a country on the FATF 's grey list or black list, such as a portion of their source of wealth originating from that country, it is possible they may try to disguise or obscure that connection to avoid additional scrutiny.

As noted below, this may include there being an ineffective government, or political instability;</p> </li> <li> <p>the level of corruption risk may increase where the customer is a PEP. Supervised persons should therefore consider how much influence their customer deploys in that country and assess the risk that their source of wealth has been tainted by the proceeds of corruption;</p> </li> <li>those in which there is no, or little, confidence in the rule of law, in particular the quality of contract enforcement, property rights, the police and the courts, e.g., those highlighted as a concern in the Worldwide Governance Indicators project;</li> <li>those in which there is no, or little, confidence in government effectiveness, including the quality of the civil service and the degree of its independence from political pressures, e.g., those highlighted as a concern in the Worldwide Governance Indicators project;</li> <li>those that are politically unstable, e.g., those highlighted as a concern in the Worldwide Governance Indicators project, or which may be considered to be a 'failed state', e.g., those listed in the Failed State Index (central government is so weak or ineffective that it has little practical control over much of its territory; non-provision of public services; widespread corruption and criminality; refugees and involuntary movement of populations; sharp economic decline);</li> <li>those that are the subject of sanctions measures that are in place in Jersey or elsewhere, e.g., those dealing with the abuse of human rights of misappropriation of State funds;</li> <li>those that lack transparency, or which have excessive secrecy laws, e.g. those identified by the OECD as having committed to internationally agreed tax standards, but which have not yet implemented those standards;</li> <li>those with inadequate regulatory and supervisory standards on international cooperation and information exchange, e.g., those identified by the Financial Stability Board as just making material progress towards demonstrating sufficiently strong adherence, or being non-cooperative, where it may not be possible to investigate the provenance of funds introduced into the financial system.</li> </ul> <p>68. In addition to the above, supervised persons should also consider whether a customer has a relevant connection to a country or territory named in Appendix D1 of this Handbook (countries or territories for which a FATF call for action applies), as well as those that are generally considered to be un-cooperative in the fight against money laundering, the financing of terrorism, and the financing of proliferation.</p> <p>69. Country risk -A connection to a country, territory or area that presents a lower risk of money laundering, the financing of terrorism, or the financing of proliferation. The following factors may be indicative of lower risk:</p> <ul> <li>a favourable rating in the Worldwide Governance Indicators project;</li> <li>the application of national financial reporting standards that follow international financial reporting standards, e.g., those countries identified by the European Commission as having generally accepted accounting principles that are equivalent to International Financial Reporting Standards;</li> <li>a commitment to international export control regimes (Missile Technology Control Regime, the Australia Group, the Nuclear Suppliers Group, Wassenaar Arrangement and the Zangger Committee);</li> <li> <p>a favourable assessment by the Financial Stability Board concerning adherence to regulatory and supervisory standards on international cooperation and information exchange;</p> </li> <li> <p>familiarity of a supervised person with a country, territory or area, including knowledge of its local legislation, regulations and rules, as well as the structure and extent of regulatory oversight, for example as a result of a supervised person's own or group operations within that country, territory or area.</p> </li> </ul> <p>70. Product or service risk -Features that may be attractive to money launderers or those financing terrorism or proliferation of weapons of mass destruction:</p> <ul> <li>ability to make payments to, or receive funds from, external parties;</li> <li>ability to pay in or withdraw cash;</li> <li>ability to migrate from one product or service to another;</li> <li>use of numbered accounts (without reference to the name of the customer );</li> <li>a bility to use 'hold mail' facilities and 'care of' addresses which are not temporary arrangements;</li> <li>ability to place funds in client, pooled, nominee or other accounts, where funds are mingled with those of other persons;</li> <li>ability to place sealed parcels or sealed envelopes in safe custody boxes.</li> </ul> <p>71. Product or service risk -Features that may indicate a higher risk of money laundering, the financing of terrorism, or the financing of proliferation:</p> <ul> <li>work which is outside the supervised person's normal range of expertise -the money launderer might be targeting the supervised person to avoid answering too many potentially revealing questions.</li> </ul> <p>72. Instructions that are unusual in themselves or that are unusual for the supervised person, or the customer may give rise to concern, particularly where no rational or logical explanation can be given. Additional service area vulnerabilities and risk factors specific to certain types of supervised business are set out in the sector-specific Sections 14.4, 15.3 and 16.2 of this Handbook.</p> <p>73. When assessing product or service risk, it is important not to restrict the assessment to the specific services being provided by the supervised person to the customer. For example, whilst the supervised person may only provide services regarding the portion of a customer's wealth based in the UK, the customer themselves may also have diverse, volatile holdings in higher-risk jurisdictions and carry out activities considered to be more exposed to money laundering, terrorist financing, or proliferation financing risk. The wider context of the customer's activities should be considered.</p> <p>74. In respect of the above paragraph, a supervised person is not required to obtain a granular list of every asset held by the customer globally. The information obtained should be sufficient for the supervised person to make an informed assessment of the risk presented by the customer's wider activities.</p> <p>75. An additional section covering the issuance of Prepaid Cards and their associated risks is set out as section 3.3.6 of this Handbook.</p> <p>76. Delivery risk -Features that may be attractive to money launderers or those financing terrorism:</p> <ul> <li>non-face to face relationships - product or service delivered exclusively by post, telephone, internet, video call etc. where there is no physical contact with the customer;</li> <li> <p>indirect relationship with the customer - use of reliance on obliged persons or other third parties;</p> </li> <li> <p>a vailability of 'straight -through processing' of customer transactions (where payments may be made electronically without the need for manual intervention by a supervised person ).</p> </li> </ul> <p>77. Customer -specific risk -Features that may indicate whether a customer is a money launderer or is financing terrorism or financing proliferation:</p> <ul> <li>type of customer. An example would be an individual who meets any of the definitions of a PEP. This may (but not always) present a higher risk:</li> <li>A supervised person should be particularly aware of the enhanced corruption risk which may be posed by 'sovereign actors'. These individuals are PEPs who work for or are connected to national governments and have control over pooled national funds. A common example would be the senior executive of a State-owned body which pools funds from sources like central bank reserves and export revenue, such as a sovereign wealth fund;</li> <li>Engaging with a customer who holds a senior position in a State-owned body, or having a business relationship with the body itself, can pose an enhance risk of corruption. Examples of how the increased risk of corruption linked to these types of PEPs might crystallise include:</li> <li>if the PEP siphons away money which legitimately belongs to the sovereign wealth fund via a trust and company structure, for their own personal gain; or</li> <li>where the State-owned corporation itself is involved in illicit activity, as opposed to one or two 'bad actors' within the organisation. In this scenario, the corporation might utilise a structure to buy up key resources to deliberately manipulate their market price, for the benefit of the equally corrupt national government.</li> <li>nature and scope of business activities generating the funds/assets. The below examples may indicate higher risk:</li> <li>a customer conducting 'sensitive' activities (as defined by the JFSC 's Sound Business Policy) or conducting activities which are prohibited if carried on with certain countries;</li> <li>a customer engaged in higher risk trading activities (examples include, but are not limited to, trading in volatile currency pairs, assets linked to emerging market, cryptocurrencies and crypto assets);</li> <li>a customer engaged in business activities which fall within the Table of the JFSC 's Sound Business Policy;</li> <li>a customer engaged in a business which involves handling significant amounts of cash.</li> <li>transparency of customer. For example:</li> <li>persons that are subject to public disclosure rules, e.g., on exchanges or regulated markets (or majority-owned and consolidated subsidiaries of such persons), or subject to licensing by a statutory regulator, e.g. the Jersey Competition Regulatory Authority may indicate lower risk;</li> <li>customers where the structure or nature of the entity or relationship makes it difficult to identify the true Beneficial owners and controllers may indicate higher risk, for example those with nominee directors, nominee shareholders or which have issued bearer shares.</li> <li> <p>behaviour by the customer may indicate a higher risk. For example:</p> </li> <li> <p>whilst face-to-face contact with customers is not always necessary or possible, an excessively obstructive or secretive customer may be a cause for concern;</p> </li> <li>where a customer requests undue levels of secrecy, a customer is reluctant or unwilling to provide adequate explanations or documents, or where it appears that an ' audit trail' has been deliberately broken or unnecessarily layered;</li> <li>where there is no commercial rationale or logical explanation for use of the products or services that are being sought;</li> <li>reputation of customer. For example, a well-known, reputable person, with a long history in their industry, and with abundant independent and reliable information about it and its Beneficial owners and controllers may indicate lower risk;</li> <li>jurisdiction of customer. If the customer is based outside Jersey, supervised persons will need to consider the rationale as to why the customer is seeking services outside of their home jurisdiction. The lack of an appropriate rationale may indicate higher risk;</li> <li>the regularity or duration of the business relationship. For example, longstanding business relationships involving frequent customer contact that result in a high level of understanding of the customer may indicate lower risk;</li> <li>type and complexity of relationship. The below examples may indicate higher risk:</li> <li>the use of overly complex or opaque structures with different layers of entities situated in two or more countries;</li> <li>cross-border transactions involving counterparties in different parts of the world;</li> <li>the unexplained use of corporate structures and express trust s;</li> <li>the use of nominee and bearer shares;</li> <li>value of assets handled, e.g., higher value assets may indicate higher risk;</li> <li>v alue and frequency of cash or other 'bearer' transactions (e.g., travellers' cheques and electronic money purses), e.g., a higher value and/or frequency may indicate higher risk;</li> <li>delegation of authority by the customer. For example, the use of powers of attorney, mixed boards and representative offices may indicate higher risk;</li> <li>involvement of persons other than Beneficial owners and controllers in the operation of a business relationship may indicate higher risk;</li> <li>in the case of an express trust, the nature of the relationship between the settlor(s) and beneficiaries with a vested interest, other beneficiaries and persons who are the object of a power. For example, a trust that is established for the benefit of the close family of the settlor may indicate a lower risk;</li> <li>in the case of a life assurance policy, the identity and risk profile of any named beneficiary to the policy.</li> </ul>","tags":["section-3"]},{"location":"sections/03-identification-overview/#3342-external-data-sources","title":"3.3.4.2 External data sources","text":"<p>78.

Whilst prepaid cards do not automatically present a higher risk of money laundering, terrorist financing, or proliferation financing, issuers will need to consider the specific risk factors of each card issued and determine its risk assessment based on the same.

An accumulation of multiple risk factors will increase the overall risk level -such an accumulation is often seen in cases where prepaid cards have been used to facilitate criminal activities.</p> <ul> <li>Prepaid cards are portable and easily transported cross-border. The current definition of cash and bearer negotiable instruments in the Customs and Excise (Jersey) Law 1999 does not extend to prepaid cards and there is no requirement to report mailing or shipping such cards abroad. Furthermore, it can be difficult for law enforcement, customs, or border guards to determine and potentially seize the monetary value stored on a prepaid card. This is particularly relevant when prepaid cards have high load limits and are used to transport the proceeds of criminal activities;</li> <li>Ownership of the card may be transferred to an unidentified bearer (i.e., from the customer to another person);</li> <li>Prepaid cards may be purchased, and funds loaded, reloaded, redeemed, or withdrawn on a non-face-to-face basis;</li> <li>Prepaid cards may be funded by cash which could be the proceeds of criminal activity. Cards also provide access to cash by way of ATMs, ' cash back ' functionality or redemption;</li> <li>Prepaid cards may be funded by unidentified third parties and by other electronic products;</li> <li> <p>The card may have a high transaction limit or no transaction limit at all. Prepaid cards that allow high values to be loaded, have high or no transaction value limits and high or no transaction frequency limits increase the risk of money laundering, the financing of terrorism, or the financing of proliferation;</p> </li> <li> <p>Individual customers or groups of customers may hold, have access to, or control multiple cards. Multiple cards can be transported or sent across borders in an attempt to circumvent the usual controls of cross-border cash movements;</p> </li> <li>Prepaid cards may be used to make frequent or high value cross-border transactions by allowing customers to use funds loaded on their cards to be transferred onwards to other persons (person to person or business to business transfers)</li> <li>Most prepaid card programmes involve a number of agents which may be based in several different countries and territories. As a result of this segmentation there may be a lack of consistent CDD measures being applied across the issuer's business</li> <li>Prepaid card operators typically outsource business and compliance functions to overseas locations, where the legislation may not necessarily follow international standards.</li> </ul>","tags":["section-3"]},{"location":"sections/03-identification-overview/#3365-case-study-use-of-prepaid-cards-to-launder-the-proceeds-of-crime","title":"3.3.6.5 Case study -Use of prepaid cards to launder the proceeds of crime","text":"<p>Guidance</p> <p>104. Prepaid currency cards have been used by individuals in Jersey to launder the proceeds of drug trafficking.

In the case of the latter method, funds loaded locally were then withdrawn overseas, over a period of 34 months.</p> <p>105.

The effect of this is to create an environment in which identification measures in respect of a customer (or other person) is applied through a trusted external party and where the customer (or other person) is physically present.</p> <p>49. Suitable certification is not to be confused with a case where a supervised person uses Article 16 of the Money Laundering Order - which allows reliance to be placed on reliance identification measures that have already been completed by an obliged person where evidence of identity that may subsequently be provided by that obliged person may now be out of date, and where the obliged person has a continuing responsibility to the supervised person in respect of record-keeping and access to records -in which case section 5 of this Handbook is relevant.</p> <p>50. Nor should the provisions in Sections 4.4.5 and 4.5.7 of this Handbook for copy documentation to be provided by a supervised TSCP be confused with suitable certification.</p> <p>Guidance</p> <p>51. For suitable certification to be effective, an individual will need to personally present an original document to an acceptable suitable certifier who is subject to professional rules (or equivalent) providing for the integrity of the certifier's conduct.</p> <p>52. Acceptable persons to certify evidence of identity (suitable certifiers) may include:</p> <ul> <li>a member of the judiciary, a senior civil servant, or a serving police or customs officer;</li> <li>an officer of an embassy, consulate or high commission of the country of issue of documentary evidence of identity;</li> <li>an individual who is a member of a professional body that sets and enforces ethical standards, for example an Advocate or Solicitor;</li> <li>an individual that is qualified to undertake certification services under authority of the Certification and International Trade Committee (in Jersey this service is available through the Jersey Chamber of Commerce);</li> <li>a director, officer, or manager of either:</li> <li> <p>a person carrying on a financial services business which is regulated and operates in a well-regulated country or territory; or</p> </li> <li> <p>a branch or subsidiary of a group headquartered in a well-regulated country or territory which applies group standards to subsidiaries and branches worldwide and tests the application of and compliance with such standards.</p> </li> </ul> <p>53. In determining whether a country or territory is well-regulated, a supervised person may have regard to:</p> <ul> <li>the development and standing of the country or territory's regulatory framework; and</li> <li>recent independent assessments of its regulatory environment, such as those conducted and published by the IMF, the FATF and FSRBs.</li> </ul> <p>54. Best efforts should be exercised to secure a certified copy of photographic evidence of identity that is of adequate quality, e.g., the photograph is clear, and any text is legible.</p> <p>55. A higher level of assurance will be provided where the relationship between the certifier and the subject is of a professional rather than personal nature. A person cannot be a suitable certifier if they are:</p> <ul> <li>related to the person being identified by birth or marriage;</li> <li>in a relationship or living with the person being identified.</li> </ul> <p>Guidance</p> <p>56. A suitable certification may take the following forms:</p> <ul> <li>a hand-written certification which meets the criteria as described in paragraphs 57 and 58 below; or</li> <li>an electronic certification which is produced using software as described in paragraph 59 below.</li> </ul> <p>57. A supervised person may demonstrate that it has obtained evidence under Article 3(2)(a) of the Money Laundering Order that is reasonably capable of verifying that a person to be identified is who they are said to be when it:</p> <ul> <li>obtains a true copy, signed, and dated by the suitable certifier, of a document that is accompanied by the confirmation set out in paragraph 63 below and adequate information as set out in paragraph 65 below so that they may be contacted in the event of a query.</li> </ul> <p>58. Applying a risk-based approach -for example where the suitable certifier is connected to a higher risk country or territory, based in a different country or territory to that of the person to be identified, or there is reason to believe that certification may not be effective -the supervised person should take additional steps in line with paragraph 66 below to validate the credentials of the suitable certifier.</p> <p>59. Electronic/digital signature software is available that locks a certification into a pdf, or a similar file type, which cannot be tampered with. A supervised person must be aware of and comfortable with the reliability of the software used. The electronic/digital signature solution must lock the certification into the document for it to be acceptable.</p> <p>60. Article 9A of the Electronic Communications Law provides that a signature, seal, attestation, or notarisation is not to be denied legal effect, validity, or enforceability only because it is in electronic form. Therefore, the certification does not need to be a handwritten signature on a document. It can be an electronic/digital signature which is technologically attached to the document. Article 9C(2) of the Electronic Communications Law provides that a person (Person A) may authorise another person to attach Person A's electronic signature to the document on Person A's behalf. It may not, however, simply be an electronic image/photocopy placed on that document (for example a handwritten signature copied onto a document (electronically or physically).</p> <p>61. In the case of the affixation of an electronic signature to certify a document, we would expect that the suitable certifier is in receipt of the relevant original documentation (as described in 4.3.2 of this Handbook ) or an electronic statement. The suitable certifier may then produce an electronic copy of such original document and affix their electronic signature in line with the detail provided in paragraphs 59 and 60 above. This would create an electronically certified document.</p> <p>62. It is not a requirement for a document which has been electronically certified to be received directly from the certifier.</p> <p>63. The confirmation should state that the copy of the document is a true copy of an original document (or extract thereof) that includes information on the identity and/or residential address of an individual.</p> <p>64. In a case where the document to be certified relates to a legal arrangement or legal person, then the Guidance notes in this section apply, except that the documents to be certified will be those that provide evidence of identity of that arrangement or person.</p> <p>65. An adequate level of information to be provided by a suitable certifier will include their name, position or capacity, their address and a telephone number, or email address, at which they can be contacted. This applies regardless of what method of certification is used.</p> <p>66. The additional steps to be taken to validate the credentials of the suitable certifier may include considering factors such as:</p> <ul> <li>the stature and track record of the suitable certifier;</li> <li>previous experience of accepting certifications from suitable certifiers in that profession or country or territory;</li> <li>the adequacy of the framework to counter money laundering, the financing of terrorism, or the financing of proliferation in place in the country or territory in which the suitable certifier is located; and</li> <li>the extent to which that framework applies to the suitable certifier.</li> </ul>","tags":["section-4"]},{"location":"sections/04-identification-measures/#4331-certification-methods-not-considered-to-be-suitable-certification","title":"4.3.3.1 Certification methods not considered to be suitable certification","text":"<p>Guidance</p> <p>67.

With the ongoing development of remote working and circumstances where customers are not physically present, supervised persons are increasingly making use of smart phone and tablet applications to capture information, copy documents and take images, liveness checks (including micro streaming) or video recordings of customers as part of their CDD processes (defined in this Handbook as E-ID ).

The guidance in this section may also be relevant in situations where similar processes are undertaken but carried out through means other than smart phone and tablet applications, e.g., the use of self-service kiosks with similar document and image capturing and verification technology.</p> <p>76. To adequately consider the risks associated with E-ID, the supervised person's board/senior management should clearly identify, fully understand, and document what the E-ID application does and does not do. For example:</p> <ul> <li>is it to be used only to collect information about an individual (finding out identity)?</li> <li>is it to be used to obtain evidence of that indi vidual's identity?</li> <li>is it to be used to collect more general relationship information about an individual from that individual, e.g., source of funds ?</li> <li>is it to be used to collect information about an individual from reliable and independent data sources? If so, where do these data sources originate and have they been assessed as to their reliability and/or independence?</li> </ul> <p>77. Where it is identified that an E-ID application does not cover particular elements of identification measures (or more general CDD measures) then, in line with Article 13 of the Money Laundering Order, those elements should continue to be applied using a supervised person's existing systems and controls (including policies and procedures ). For example, a supervised person could decide to use an E-ID application to find out and evidence identity, whilst, at the same time, employ a more traditional method to establish and verify a customer's address.</p> <p>78. The JFSC is aware that a range of E-ID applications are commercially available for use by supervised persons. Supervised persons might also make use of E-ID applications which have been developed in-house or within their wider corporate group. The guidance provided in this section is not intended to express any preference or favour towards any particular method of E-ID, or any particular E-ID application. The JFSC does not endorse, nor advise on, specific methods or providers available to supervised persons. It remains the decision of the supervised person whether E-ID should be utilised in any given circumstance, and/or whether the supervised person will develop its own E-ID application for these purposes or select an E-ID application that is commercially available.

Article 3(4) of the Money Laundering Order explains that identification of a person means:</p> <ul> <li>finding out the identity of that person, including that person's name and legal status and</li> <li>obtaining evidence based on documents, data or information from a reliable and independent source, that is reasonably capable of verifying that the person to be identified is who they are said to be and satisfies the person responsible for the identification that the evidence does establish that fact.</li> </ul> <p>80. Using an E-ID application is one way of obtaining evidence of identity. Section 4.3.2 of this Handbook explains how a supervised person may demonstrate that it has obtained evidence that is reasonably capable of verifying that an individual to be identified is who they are said to be. Among other things, it states that use of the following documentary evidence will be reasonably capable of verifying an individual's identity:</p> <ul> <li>a current passport, or copy of such a passport certified by a suitable certifier;</li> <li>a current national identity card, or copy of such a national identity card certified by a suitable certifier; or</li> <li>a current driving licence or copy of such a driving licence certified by a suitable certifier.</li> </ul> <p>81. As an alternative to using documentary evidence, section 4.3.4 of this Handbook permits, in certain circumstances, the use of independent data sources to verify that the person to be identified is who they are said to be.

Article 15(1)(b) of the Money Laundering Order requires a relevant person to apply enhanced CDD measures when the customer has not been physically present for identification purposes.</p> <p>Guidance</p> <p>85. The requirements under Articles 11 and 15(3) of the Money Laundering Order and the AML/CFT/CPF Codes of Practice set out at section 2.4.4 of this Handbook will apply in any circumstances where a part of the CDD process is undertaken by an independent third party or supervised person via the use of E-ID applications, where the customer is not physically present. Accordingly, when deciding whether to make use of a particular E-ID application, a supervised person is required to undertake a risk assessment comprising of the following:</p> <ul> <li>consider the risks involved in the use of the E-ID application and record the reasons why its use is appropriate;</li> <li>consider the risks involved in outsourcing any part of the CDD process to an independent third party using the E-ID application and record the reasons why such outsourcing is appropriate;</li> <li>consider whether the features of the E-ID application effectively mitigate the risks identified;</li> <li>apply any additional measures to ensure that all risks are effectively managed;</li> <li>apply, on a risk-sensitive basis, enhanced CDD measures to take account of the particular risks arising due to the fact that the customer has not been physically present for identification purposes.</li> </ul> <p>86. A risk assessment as described in the paragraph above is not required to be undertaken by the supervised person on each occasion that the particular E-ID application is used, but rather when considering whether to incorporate the use of that E-ID application into its CDD measures.</p> <p>87. When using technology to on-board a customer remotely, i.e., when a customer is not physically present, and conduct activities by digital or other non-physical present means, for example when interacting via a video call, mail or telephone, it is required that enhanced CDD measures be applied.</p> <p>88.

Risk: Documents are tampered with or forged:</p> <ul> <li>when original documents are not physically presented, it can be more difficult for a supervised person to detect that documents have been tampered with or forged.

This section lists some potential features of E-ID applications (and wrap-around systems) that may be used to mitigate the risks listed at section 4.3.5.2 of this Handbook. Where the E-ID application (or connected system) does not sufficiently mitigate the risk, the supervised person will need to ensure that its CDD systems and controls (including policies and procedures ) incorporate measures specifically designed to do so.</p> <p>98. The features described in the Guidance notes below do not represent an exhaustive list. A supervised person may consider other features, systems and controls (including policies and procedures ) to be appropriate.</p> <p>Guidance</p> <p>99. Features of E-ID applications (and wrap-around systems) that may be used to mitigate the risk that documents have been tampered with or forged may include:</p> <ul> <li>the copy of the document is of a very high level of clarity and resolution, such that its contents can be adequately reviewed without undue difficulty (i.e., the clarity and resolution is still sufficient when zooming in to view a particular element of the document);</li> <li>the copy of the document is automatically matched to a predefined 'template' for the particular form of identity document used;</li> <li>the data in the main body of the document is compared to biometric or other data stored in the document's machine-readable zone (MRZ) code;</li> <li>data on the document is automatically examined for use of unauthorised print fonts and unexpected character spacing;</li> <li>the copy of the document is automatically examined to enable detection of fraudulent documents on the basis of that documents' security features ( e.g., watermarks, biographical data, photographs, lamination, UV sensitive ink lines holograms, micro-text, etc.) and the location of various elements in the document (i.e. optical character recognition);</li> <li>the copy of the document is examined by individuals specifically trained to detect tampering/forgery (e.g., ex-border agents), or the E-ID application has been designed with the characteristics of this training/expertise in mind.</li> </ul> <p>100. Features of E-ID applications (and wrap-around systems) that may be used to mitigate the risk that a copy of a document or photograph has been tampered with or forged before or during transmission may include:</p> <ul> <li>the E-ID application itself controls the process of copying the document, taking photographs and transmitting the same, allowing no opportunity to tamper with or manipulate documents or photographs. This is in contrast with, for example, a prospective customer taking a photograph of a document and transmitting the pdf file by e-mail, which presents multiple opportunities for interference;</li> <li>a highly secure connection is used to transmit copies of documents and photographs;</li> <li>the E-ID application's security is regularly tested to guard against hacking or other security breaches.</li> </ul> <p>101. Features of E-ID applications (and wrap-around systems) that may be used to mitigate the risk that documents presented are stolen (or their use unauthorised) may include:</p> <ul> <li>a \"selfie\" photograph of the customer is taken and biometrically compared/matched to the photograph on the identity document presented, in order to verify that they relate to the same individual;</li> <li>a video or a \"microstream' of photographs is taken to identify facial movements, which may help to confirm that the customer is present at the time that the video/stream of photographs is taken.

Examples of these are set out in the Guidance notes below.</p> <p>105. Biometric and similar matching/checking technology is referred to in the Guidance notes below. The FATF describes biometrics as an individual's personal biological or behavioural characteristics. E-ID applications may make use of the following biometrics as part of their verification processes:</p> <ul> <li>biophysical biometrics: attributes, such as fingerprints, iris patterns, voiceprints and facial recognition;</li> <li>biomechanical biometrics: attributes, such as keystroke mechanics, are the product of unique interactions of an individual's muscles, skel etal system, and nervous system;</li> <li>behavioural biometric patterns: attributes, based on the new computational social science discipline of social physics, consist of an individual's various patterns of movement and usage in geospatial temporal data streams, and include, for example, an individual's email or text message patterns, file access log, mobile phone usage, and geolocation patterns.</li> </ul> <p>Guidance</p> <ol> <li> <p>Use of video calls where an identity document is produced during the call for comparison, but no biometric or similar matching/checking technology is employed, e.g., the customer just holds up their passport during a video call -this method is not considered to be appropriate due to:</p> </li> <li> <p>there being no independent authentication process alongside the identification document being produced, hence the process is not adequately robust;</p> </li> <li> <p>the risk of 'deep fake' technology being utilised, whereby the video image and voice of an individual can be manipulated to look and sound like another individual. Again, biometric and similar matching/checking technology is considered necessary for this risk to be adequately mitigated.</p> </li> <li> <p>Whilst a supervised person may wish to hold a video call to meet a potential customer and discuss elements of the proposed business relationship (including finding out identity or other customer information), that video call is not sufficient for the purposes of obtaining evidence of identity. An E-ID application, or other alternative method, may be used for that purpose, enabling the independent authentication process. 107. Using scanned copies of documents (i.e., re-productions of original documents which have not been suitably certified) as evidence of identity -this method is not considered to be appropriate due to:</p> </li> <li> <p>the risk that an identity document has been tampered with or forged not being mitigated using specialist checks. The scanned copies in this case are in effect non-certified and nonauthenticated. If scanned copies are to be used as evidence, they should be independently verified/authenticated.

Jersey law recognises two distinct forms of legal arrangement: the trust and the limited partnership.</p> <p>123. Jersey trusts law comprises both the Trust Law, as amended, and the Jersey customary law of trusts. Limited partnerships are established under the Limited Partnerships (Jersey) Law 1994. Limited Liability Partnerships, Separate Limited Partnerships and Incorporated Limited Partnerships all have legal personality and are therefore covered in section 4.5 of this Handbook.</p> <p>124. There are a wide variety of trusts ranging from large, nationally, and internationally active organisations subject to a high degree of public scrutiny and transparency, through to trusts set up under testamentary arrangements or established for wealth management purposes. Trusts may also be established as Collective investment scheme s -known as a unit trusts.</p> <p>125. A legal arrangement cannot form a business relationship or carry out a one-off transaction itself. It is the trustee(s) of the trust or general partner(s) of the limited partnership who will enter a business relationship or carry out the one-off transaction with a supervised person on behalf of the legal arrangement and who will be the customer (s). In line with Article 3 of the Money Laundering Order, the trust or limited partnership will be the third party on whose behalf the trustee(s) or general partner(s) act(s).</p> <p>126. In forming a business relationship or carrying out a one-off transaction with a trustee or general partner, a supervised person will be dependent on information provided by the trustee or general partner (a supervised Trust Company Business or otherwise) relating to the legal arrangement and persons concerned with the legal arrangement (set out in Article 3(7) of the Money Laundering Order ). When determining the risk assessment for a legal arrangement (section 3.3 of this Handbook ), the risk factors set out in section 3.3.4.1 of this Handbook and Section 7.15.1 of this Handbook will be relevant in deciding whether it is appropriate to use information provided by the trustee or general partner. In addition, the monitoring measures maintained by a supervised person (see section 6 of this Handbook ) may provide additional comfort that relevant and up-to-date information on identity has been found out.</p> <p>127. In the case of a unit trust which is a third party, individual investors into the unit trust are not considered to be settlors for the purpose of Article 3(7)(a) of the Money Laundering Order. However, the investors may in certain circumstances be considered Beneficial owners and/or controllers and are customers of the fund (see section 13 of this Handbook ).</p> <p>128. The following provisions apply to situations where a trustee of an express trust or general partner of a limited partnership is the customer of a supervised person. Sector-specific sections for Trust Company Business and funds and fund operators explain the identification measures to be applied by a trustee or general partner itself in respect of the legal arrangement. See sections 12 and 13 of this Handbook.</p> <p>129. The provisions will also assist with the identification of ultimate Beneficial owners and/or controllers and will be relevant in situations where a legal arrangement (through the trustee or general partner) is:</p> <ul> <li>the owner or controller of a customer, because of a requirement in Article 3(2)(c)(iii) of the Money Laundering Order to identify the individuals who are the customer's Beneficial owners and/or controllers; or</li> <li>a third party on whose behalf a customer is acting, because of a requirement in Article 3(2)(b)(ii) of the Money Laundering Order to identify the individuals who are the third party's Beneficial owners and/or controllers.</li> </ul> <p>130. Where the trustee or general partner is a supervised person carrying on regulated business or is a person who carries on equivalent business to any category of regulated business, it may be possible to apply CDD exemptions under Article 17B and Article 18(3) of the Money Laundering Order. See section 7 of this Handbook.</p> <p>131. The measures that must be applied by a supervised person where a third party is a trust need not include a settlor of a trust who is deceased.</p> <p>132. The measures that must be applied to obtain evidence of identity of beneficiaries and persons who are the object of a power and have been identified as presenting higher risk will necessarily reflect the verification methods that are available at a particular time to the trustee. For example, it may not be appropriate to request evidence directly from the beneficiary or object of a power.</p> <p>133. Where a supervised person is not familiar with the form of evidence of identity obtained to verify identity, appropriate measures may be necessary to satisfy itself that the evidence is genuine.</p> <p>134. Notwithstanding the requirement to find out identity and obtain evidence of identity in relation to the trustee, the trust and those individuals listed in Article 3(7) of the Money Laundering Order, a supervised person is not expected to collect information on the detailed terms of the trust, nor rights of the beneficiaries.</p>","tags":["section-4"]},{"location":"sections/04-identification-measures/#441-finding-out-identity-legal-arrangement-that-is-a-trust","title":"4.4.1 Finding out identity -Legal arrangement that is a trust","text":"<p>Guidance</p> <p>135.

Unit trusts are therefore primarily for investment and differ in structure from the more traditional discretionary trust. A unit trust may be established for different purposes, some examples of why it may be established include:</p> <ul> <li>by someone who wishes to use it as an investment vehicle for themselves and others but wishes to share the costs as well as the profits;</li> <li>by an investment manager or investment bank to offer an investment opportunity to its customers;</li> <li>as a holding vehicle for property or other assets.</li> </ul> <p>170. The settlor of a trust is defined in the Trust Law as '\u2026 a person who provides trust property or makes a te stamentary disposition on trust or to a trust'. Consideration should be given as to whether a promoter/instigator/arranger is the settlor, i.e., whether they contribute property to the unit trust directly or indirectly. Where the promoter/instigator/arranger is not a settlor the supervised person should find out who they are to be able to adequately assess the risk of the relationship with the customer, being the trustee of the unit trust.</p> <p>171. While the individual investors are not considered to be settlors for the purposes of Article 3(7)(a) of the Money Laundering Order (see section 13.3.3 of this Handbook ), each of the unit holders will be customers of the trustee (who is acting on behalf of the unit trust), investing their money into the unit trust. This may include the promoter/instigator/arranger as an investor. In the Trust Law a unit holders' entitlement is described as 'participation by them as beneficiaries under the trust. '</p> <p>172. The trustee of the unit trust is required to maintain adequate, accurate and current basic and beneficial ownership information in relation to the unit trust (see section 12.2.4.1 of this Handbook ). The trustee will apply identification measures to each of the unit holders (the trustee's customers ) based on the structure of that unit holder, whether they be individuals, legal persons, or legal arrangements (see section 4 of this Handbook and section 12.2.4.1 of this Handbook ).</p> <p>173. Where a supervised person forms a business relationship with the trustee(s) who are acting for the benefit of the unit trust they should apply identification measures to:</p> <ul> <li>The settlor (see paragraph 170 above) and (if any) the protector;</li> <li>The trustee (there may be more than one) who is the Governing body of the unit trust and contracts on its behalf and is the ' customer '.</li> <li>Any third parties on whose behalf the trustee(s) are acting. When dealing with a unit trust, a supervised person may demonstrate compliance with Article 3(7) (b) (i) of the Money Laundering Order where they apply identification measures to those unit holders who exercise control over the unit trust or who are deemed to have a material controlling interest of 25% (in lower risk scenarios). In higher risks scenarios, unit holders holding interests of less than 25% may need to be identified and verified. Even where unit holders are not identified and verified (as they fall below the thresholds) sufficient information will need to be obtained about the unit holders to know who they are for the purposes of the risk assessment, customer profiles (see section 13.2.5 of this Handbook ) may be used; and</li> <li>any other parties who exercise ultimate control over the trust, such as by other means -for example where an investment manager is the instigator of the unit trust and manages the investments of the unit trust.</li> </ul> <p>174. Good practice would be to ensure the terms of engagement/business with the trustee(s) require notification of changes to the beneficial ownership and control structure and any other events that may impact on the risk of the customer relationship.</p>","tags":["section-4"]},{"location":"sections/04-identification-measures/#45-obligation-to-find-out-identity-and-obtain-evidence-legal-persons","title":"4.5 Obligation to find out identity and obtain evidence: Legal Persons","text":"<p>175. Jersey law recognises several distinct forms of legal person, in particular:</p> <ul> <li>companies, established under the Companies Law;</li> <li>foundations, established under the Foundations Law;</li> <li>limited liability partnerships, established under the Limited Liability Partnerships (Jersey) Law 2017;</li> <li>separate limited partnerships, established under the Separate Limited Partnerships (Jersey) Law 2011;</li> <li>incorporated limited partnerships, established under the Incorporated Limited Partnerships (Jersey) Law 2011;</li> <li>limited liability companies, established under the Limited Liability Companies (Jersey) Law 2018.</li> </ul> <p>176. The following provisions apply to situations where a legal person is the customer.</p> <p>177. The provisions will also assist with the identification of ultimate Beneficial owners and/or controllers and will be relevant in situations where a legal person is:</p> <ul> <li>a person connected to a legal arrangement, because of a requirement in Article 3(2)(b)(iii) of the Money Laundering Order to identify each person who falls within Article 3(7) of the Money Laundering Order, and each individual who is that person's Beneficial owner and/or controller;</li> <li>the owner or controller of a customer, because of a requirement in Article 3(2)(c)(iii) of the Money Laundering Order to identify the individuals who are the customer ' s Beneficial owners and/or controllers;</li> <li>acting on behalf of a customer (e.g., is acting according to a power of attorney, or has signing authority over an account);</li> <li>a third party on whose behalf a customer is acting, because of a requirement in Article 3(2)(b)(ii) of the Money Laundering Order to identify the individuals who are the third party's Beneficial owners and/or controllers.</li> </ul> <p>178. The Companies Law allows for the incorporation of cell companies: ICCs and PCCs. Each of these types of cell companies may establish one or more cells.</p> <p>179. In the case of a PCC, each cell, despite having its own memorandum of association, shareholders, and directors, as well as being treated for the purposes of the Companies Law as if it were a company, does not have a legal personality separate from the cell company. Accordingly, where a cell wishes to contract with another party, it does so through the cell company acting on its behalf. To ensure that creditors and third parties are aware of this position, a director of the cell company is under a duty to notify the counterparties to a transaction that the cell company is acting in respect of a particular cell.</p> <p>180. Where a supervised person establishes a business relationship or enters into a one-off transaction with a cell of a PCC, because the cell does not have the ability to enter into arrangements or contract in its own name, for the purposes of Article 3 of the Money Laundering Order, the PCC will be taken to be a customer acting for a third party and the particular cell will be taken to be the third party that is a person other than an individual.</p> <p>181. By contrast, in the case of an ICC, each cell has its own separate legal personality, with the ability to enter into arrangements or contracts and to hold assets and liabilities in its own name. Where a supervised person establishes a business relationship or enters into a one-off transaction with a cell of an ICC, the cell will be taken to be the customer.</p> <p>182. In a case where the ownership structure of a legal person to be identified (Legal Person A) includes other legal persons, the beneficial owners and controllers of Legal Person A will include those individuals ultimately holding a material controlling ownership interest in Legal Person A.</p> <p>183. The identification measures to be applied to each type of person are set out in this Handbook as follows:</p> <ul> <li>a company: sections 4.5.1 and 4.5.2;</li> <li>a foundation: sections 4.5.3 and 4.5.4;</li> <li>a partnership: sections 4.5.5 and 4.5.6.</li> </ul> <p>184. For the purpose of this section, provisions that are said to apply to a company are to be taken to apply, with appropriate modification, to:</p> <ul> <li>any other body that can establish a business relationship with a supervised person or otherwise own property;</li> <li>an anstalt;</li> <li>an incorporated or unincorporated association, club, society, charity, church body, or institute;</li> <li>a mutual or friendly society;</li> <li>a co-operative;</li> <li>a provident society.</li> </ul> <p>185. Where information relating to a legal person is not available from a public source, a supervised person will be dependent on the information that is provided by the legal person. When determining the risk assessment for a legal person (section 3.3 of this Handbook ), the risk factors set out in section 3.3.4.1 of this Handbook will be relevant. The risk factors set out in section 7.15.1 of this Handbook will also be relevant in determining whether it is appropriate to use information on a legal person provided through, for example, a TCSP. In addition, the monitoring measures maintained by a supervised person (section 6 of this Handbook ) may provide additional comfort that relevant and up to date information on identity has been found out.</p> <p>186. Where a director of a company holds their role by virtue of their employment by (or position in) a business that is a supervised Jersey TCSP, separate provision is made for obtaining evidence of identity. Similar provision is made for a council member of a foundation and for a partner of a partnership.</p> <p>187. Article 2 of the Money Laundering Order, which describes those persons considered to be beneficial owners of a body corporate or a limited liability company, provides that no individual is to be treated as a beneficial owner of a person that is a body corporate or a limited liability company, the securities of which are listed on a regulated market.</p> <p>188. The measures that must be applied to obtain evidence of identity of beneficiaries and persons in whose favour the council of a foundation may exercise discretion and that have been identified as presenting higher risk will necessarily reflect the verification methods that are available at a particular time to the supervised person. For example, it may not be appropriate to request evidence directly from a person in whose favour discretion may be exercised.</p> <p>189. Where a supervised person is not familiar with a document obtained to verify identity, appropriate measures may be necessary to satisfy itself that the evidence is genuine.</p>","tags":["section-4"]},{"location":"sections/04-identification-measures/#451-finding-out-identity-legal-person-that-is-a-company","title":"4.5.1 Finding out identity -Legal person that is a company","text":"<p>Guidance</p> <p>190. A supervised person may demonstrate that it has found out the identity of a company which is a customer under Article 3(2)(c)(iii) of the Money Laundering Order where it collects all of the following:</p> <ul> <li>name of company;</li> <li>any trading names;</li> <li>date and country/territory of incorporation/registration;</li> <li> <p>official identification number;</p> </li> <li> <p>registered office address;</p> </li> <li>mailing address (if different);</li> <li>principal place of business/operations (if different); and</li> <li>names of all persons holding a senior management position.</li> </ul> <p>191. To ascertain whose identity must be found out i.e., who is/are the customer's Beneficial owner and/or controllers under Article 3(2)(c)(iii) of the Money Laundering Order, a supervised person can use a tool that is commonly known as the 'T hree Tier Test '. The 'Three Tier Test' (explanatory text and flow-chart below) relates to legal persons (e.g., companies, incorporated partnerships etc.). Individuals at Tiers 1 and 2 should be identified, and only if there are no individuals at Tiers 1 and 2 do the individuals at Tier 3 need to be identified.</p> <p>Tier 1: A supervised person may demonstrate that it has found out the identity of a person who is the customer's Beneficial owner and/or controller under Article 3(2)(c)(iii) of the Money Laundering Order where it finds out the identity of persons holding a material controlling ownership interest in the capital of the company (through direct or indirect holdings of interests or voting rights) or who exert control through other ownership interests, e.g. shareholders' agreements, power to appoint senior management, or through holding convertible stock or any outstanding debt that is convertible into voting rights; and</p> <p>Tier 2: To the extent that there is doubt as to whether the persons exercising control through ownership are beneficial owners, or where no person exerts control through ownership, a supervised person may demonstrate that it has found out the identity of a person who is the customer's Beneficial owner and/or controller under Article 3(2)(c)(iii) of the Money Laundering Order where it finds out the identity of those who exercise control through other means, e.g. those who exert control through personal connections, by participating in financing, because of close family relationships, historical or contractual associations or as a result of default on certain payments. This effectively means anyone exercising control through ownership and anyone exercising control through other means must be identified (Tier 1 and Tier 2); or</p> <ul> <li>Tier 3: Where no person is otherwise identified under Tier 1 or Tier 2 above, a supervised person may demonstrate that it has found out the identity of a person who is the customer's Beneficial owner and/or controller under Article 3(2)(c)(iii) of the Money Laundering Order where it finds out the identity of persons who exercise control through positions held (e.g. those who have and exercise strategic decision-taking powers and exercise executive control through senior management positions). In the case of other bodies, anstalts, associations, clubs, societies, charities, church bodies, institutes, mutual or friendly societies, co-operatives, and provident societies, ' senior management ' will often include members of the Governing body or committee plus executives. 192. The above information may be provided by the company.</li> </ul> <p>193. In any case where a person identified is not an individual, a supervised person may demonstrate that it has identified each individual who is that person's Beneficial owner and/or controller under Article 3(2)(c)(iii) of the Money Laundering Order where it has identified:</p> <ul> <li>(i) each individual with a material controlling ownership interest in the capital of the company (through direct or indirect holdings of interests or voting rights) or who exerts control of the company through other ownership means;</li> <li>(ii) to the extent that there is doubt as to whether the individuals exercising control through ownership are beneficial owners, or where no individual exerts control through ownership, any other individual exercising control over the company through other means.

In the case of a lower risk relationship, person(s) holding a senior management position who have and exercise authority to operate a business relationship or one-off transaction will be those who exercise control through positions held.</p> <p>195. For lower risk relationships, a general threshold of 25% is considered to indicate a material controlling ownership interest in the capital of a company.

Nor should provision for copy documentation to be provided by a CD regulated TCSP be confused with 'suitable certification', which is explained in section 4.3.3 of this Handbook.</p> <p>233.

FATF Recommendation 10 states that Financial Institutions should be required to apply that Recommendation (which deals with CDD measures) to 'existing customers ' on the basis of materiality and risk and should conduct CDD measures on such existing relationships at appropriate times. This is based on the presumption that identification measures applied historically to existing customers will have been less effective than those to be applied in line with FATF Recommendation 10.</p> <p>270. For the purposes of the Money Laundering Order the meaning of existing customer depends on the sector. In the case of a supervised business, this means a business relationship established before the Money Laundering Order came into force on 4 February 2008 and which continues. In the case of real estate agents, high value dealers, Accountants and Lawyers this means a business relationship established before the Money Laundering Order came into force on 1 May 2008 and which continues.</p> <p>271. For the avoidance of doubt, the identification measures (finding out identity and obtaining evidence) to be applied to existing customers include the collection of information that is necessary to assess the risk that a business relationship involves money laundering or the financing of terrorism, or the financing of proliferation (in line with Article 3(5) of the Money Laundering Order ). This is likely to be self-evident for an existing customer on the basis that a business relationship will have been established on or before the dates stated in the sector-specific sections below.

In some strictly limited cases, a supervised person may meet its obligation to comply with Articles 13(1)(a) or (c)(ii) ( CDD ); 15(1)(a), (b), (d), (e) or (g) ( Enhanced CDD measures ); or 15A ( Enhanced CDD Measures in relation to PEPs ) of the Money Laundering Order, and AML/CFT/CPF Codes of Practice by placing reliance on measures that have already been applied by an obliged person to find out the identity of a mutual customer and to obtain evidence of identity.</p> <p>2. To consider what reliance might be placed on an obliged person, a supervised person will first need to determine what elements of identity must be found out and what evidence of identity is to be obtained for its customer. It will do so in accordance with Article 3 of the Money Laundering Order and the AML/CFT/CPF Codes of Practice set out in sections 3, 4 and 7 of this Handbook, and will also consider its risk assessment for the customer. Once it has determined what identification measures it is to apply, a supervised person can then consider whether those measures have already been applied by an obliged person.</p> <p>3. Where an obliged person has met its customer, who is resident in the same country or territory as the obliged person, the measures that it has taken to find out identity and to obtain evidence of identity will be different to the identification measures that must be applied by the supervised person in a case where the supervised person is resident in a different country or territory to the obliged person and customer, and where it has not met its customer. Even in a case where the supervised person and obliged person have met a customer and are resident in the same country or territory, the measures taken by the obliged person may still differ to those to be applied by the supervised person to the extent that other factors are different, for example the nature of the product or service to be provided.</p> <p>4. The effect of this is that the obliged person may not have found out all the same information on identity as the supervised person needs and may have obtained evidence of identity using different documents, data, or information. This means that, in practice, the scope to place reliance may sometimes be quite limited, and that it may be necessary for a supervised person to find out more information on identity and obtain evidence for that aspect of identity itself.</p> <p>5. However, it is not necessary for the obliged person to have found out identity or obtained evidence of identity exactly in line with policies and procedures applied by the supervised person, since Guidance notes in section 4 of this Handbook provide that there are different ways in which to apply identification measures. Also, where the obliged person is outside Jersey, different requirements and guidance will be applicable.</p> <p>6. Where an obliged person meets the requirements outlined in Article 16 of the Money Laundering Order, a supervised person is permitted to place reliance on the obliged person to have found out the identity and to have obtained evidence of the identity of:</p> <ul> <li>the supervised person's customer;</li> <li>any Beneficial owner and/or controller of that customer;</li> <li>any third party for which that customer is acting;</li> <li> <p>any Beneficial owner and/or controller of a third party for whom that customer is acting;</p> </li> <li> <p>any person purporting to act on behalf of that customer.</p> </li> </ul> <p>7. It is not possible to place reliance on an obliged person to obtain information on the purpose and intended nature of a business relationship or one-off transaction, nor to apply on-going monitoring during a business relationship.</p> <p>8. As noted above, overall CDD is always required to be undertaken by the supervised person. However, set out below are two tables summarising the elements of CDD that, in the absence of other provisions, the supervised person is required to undertake itself:</p> <p>9. Article 16 of the Money Laundering Order cannot be applied in any case where:</p> <ul> <li>a supervised person suspects money laundering, the financing of terrorism, or proliferation financing;</li> <li>a supervised person considers that there is a higher risk of money laundering, the financing of terrorism, or proliferation financing based on a risk assessment carried out under Article 16(4) of the Money Laundering Order (see section 5.1.1 of this Handbook ); or</li> <li>the obliged person has a relevant connection to an enhanced risk state (see section 7.5 of this Handbook ).</li> </ul> <p>10. Whilst the information on identity found out by the obliged person must be provided to the supervised person immediately before establishing a business relationship or carrying out a one-off transaction, a supervised person is not also required to immediately obtain evidence of identity. Evidence of identity may be held by an obliged person, so long as the supervised person is satisfied that the obliged person will provide the evidence that it holds, on request and without delay. However, it is not uncommon for evidence of identity to be called for at the same time as information on identity is provided by the obliged person.</p> <p>11. Examples of obliged persons include, but are not limited to:</p> <ul> <li>an investment advisor who arranges for a customer to invest in a financial product provided by a supervised person, where the investment is to be held in the name of the customer and not that of the investment advisor;</li> <li>a Trust Company Business who establishes a bank or investment account for a client company, trust or foundation;</li> <li>a law firm that is a supervised person carrying on supervised business;</li> </ul> CDD element Always required to be undertaken by the supervised person Identification Risk assessment. measures Obtain information on purpose/nature.

A supervised person will remain responsible for the satisfactory performance of all elements of reliance identification measures.</p> <p>13. However, where the measures taken by a supervised person are reasonable, it will have a defence should the obliged person fail to have performed satisfactory measures.</p> <p>14. Outsourcing arrangements and the appointment of AMLSP to provide AMLSP services ( AMLSP arrangements) are not included within the scope of this section, as these are distinct from circumstances in which reliance is placed on an obliged person. In an outsourcing arrangement/ AMLSP arrangement, notwithstanding that the service provider may have substantial contact with the customer, the customer ' s direct relationship is with the supervised person. The service provider services will perform the outsourced/ AMLSP services on behalf of the supervised person according to the terms of a contract with the supervised person. An example of a typical outsourcing arrangement is where a trustee of a Collective investment scheme outsources the management of the scheme to an external party.</p> <p>15. Whether a supervised person in receipt of outsourced services/ AMLSP services can be an obliged person will need to be assessed on a case-by-case basis, noting that while a supervised person using an AMLSP may be an equivalent business, it will not be a regulated business.</p> <p>16. Where information on identity found out, or evidence of that identity, is passed by an obliged person to a supervised person to comply with requirements to counter money laundering and the financing of terrorism, the Data Protection (Jersey) Law 2018 restricts the use of the information to that purpose, except where another condition for processing personal data applies.</p> <p>17. A customer may be an individual (or group of individuals) or legal person. Section 4.3 of this Handbook deals with a customer who is an individual (or group of individuals), section 4.4 of this Handbook deals with a customer (an individual or legal person) who is acting for a legal arrangement, and section 4.5 of this Handbook deals with a customer who is a legal person.</p> <p>18. Under Article 16(1) of the Money Laundering Order, in this s ection ' customer of the obliged person ' means:</p> <ul> <li>a customer of the obliged person;</li> <li>a Beneficial owner and/or controller of that customer;</li> <li>a third party for whom that customer is acting;</li> <li>a Beneficial owner and/or controller of a third party for whom that customer is acting;</li> <li>a person purporting to act on behalf of that customer.</li> </ul> <p>Statutory Requirement</p> <p>19. In some strictly limited circumstances, Article 16(2) of the Money Laundering Order provides that a relevant person may be considered to have applied the reliance identification measures where such measures have already been applied by an obliged person. Obliged person means a person who the relevant person knows or has reasonable grounds for believing is:</p> <ul> <li>a relevant person in respect of whom the JFSC discharges supervisory functions that is overseen for AML/CFT compliance in Jersey;</li> <li>a person who carries on equivalent business (refer to section 1.9 of this Handbook).</li> </ul> <p>20. Reliance must always be subject to a number of conditions.</p> <p>21. The first condition (Article 16(2)(a) of the Money Laundering Order) is that the obliged person consents to being relied upon.</p> <p>22. The second condition (Article 16(4) of the Money Laundering Order) is that identification measures have been applied by the obliged person in the course of an established business relationship or one-off transaction.</p> <p>23. The third condition (Article 16(4)(a),(b),(c) and (d) of the Money Laundering Order) is that the relevant person obtains adequate assurance in writing that the obliged person:</p> <ul> <li>has applied reliance identification measures in relation to the customer;</li> <li>has not itself relied upon another party to have applied any reliance identification measures;</li> <li>has not, in reliance on any provision in Part 3A of the Money Laundering Order (or if the obliged person is not in Jersey, a provision of similar effect), applied measures that are less than equivalent to the reliance identification measures;</li> <li>is required to keep, and does keep, evidence of the identification as described in Article 3(4)(b) of the Money Laundering Order relating to each of the obliged person's customers, including a record of such evidence.</li> </ul> <p>24. The fourth condition (Article 16(2)(b) of the Money Laundering Order) is that the obliged person immediately provides the relevant person with the information obtained from applying the reliance identification measures.</p> <p>25. To the extent that reliance is placed on an obliged person to keep hold of the evidence obtained under reliance identification measures, the fifth condition (Article 16(5) of the Money Laundering Order) is that the relevant person obtains adequate assurance in writing that the obliged person will:</p> <ul> <li>keep that evidence until the evidence has been provided to the relevant person, or until notification is received from the relevant person that the evidence is no longer required to be kept;</li> <li>provide that evidence to the relevant person at its request, and without delay.</li> </ul> <p>26. The sixth condition (Article 16(3) of the Money Laundering Order) is that, immediately before placing reliance, the relevant person assesses the risk of placing reliance and makes a written record as to the reason why it is appropriate for it to place reliance on the obliged person, having regard to:</p> <ul> <li>the higher risk of money laundering or the financing of terrorism should the obliged person fail to carry out any action specified in the assurances obtained under paragraphs 23 and 25 above;</li> <li>the risk that an obliged person will fail to provide the relevant person with evidence without delay if requested to do so by the relevant person. See section 5.1.1 of this Handbook.</li> </ul> <p>27. Under Article 16(8) of the Money Laundering Order a relevant person who relies on an obliged person under this Article must conduct tests in such manner and at such intervals as the relevant person considers appropriate in all the circumstances to establish whether:</p> <ul> <li>the obliged person has appropriate and consistent policies and procedures in place to apply reliance identification measures;</li> <li> <p>if the obliged person has not already provided the evidence to the relevant person, the obliged person does keep the evidence they have obtained during the course of applying reliance identification measures in respect of a person;</p> </li> <li> <p>the obliged person will provide that evidence without delay if requested to do so.</p> </li> </ul> <p>28. Under Article 16(8)(c) of the Money Laundering Order, testing should take into consideration whether the obliged person may be prevented, by application of law, from providing information or evidence, e.g. secrecy legislation.</p> <p>29. If, as a result of carrying out any such test, a relevant person is not satisfied that the obliged person has appropriate and consistent policies and procedures in place, keeps evidence, or will provide it without delay if requested to do so, in that particular case, Article 16(9) of the Money Laundering Order requires the relevant person to apply reliance identification measures immediately.</p> <p>30. Article 16(6)(a) of the Money Laundering Order provides that a written assurance will be adequate if it is reasonably capable of being regarded as reliable and a relevant person is satisfied that it is reliable.</p> <p>31. Article 16(6)(b) of the Money Laundering Order provides that written assurances may be provided each time that reliance is placed or through a more general arrangement with an obliged person that has an element of duration, e.g. terms of business.</p> <p>32. Article 16(7) of the Money Laundering Order states that a relevant person (including a person who was formerly a relevant person) who has given an assurance to another person under Article 16 (5) of the Money Laundering Order (or under an equivalent provision that applies outside Jersey) must, if requested by the other person, provide the person with the evidence obtained from applying the reliance identification measures.</p> <p>33. Article 16(11) of the Money Laundering Order states that nothing in this Article permits a relevant person to rely on the reliance identification measures of an obliged person if:</p> <ul> <li>the relevant person suspects money laundering or the financing of terrorism;</li> <li>the relevant person considers that there is a higher risk of money laundering on the basis of the assessment made under Article 16(3) of the Money Laundering Order;</li> <li>the obliged person is a person having a relevant connection with an enhanced risk state (within the meaning of Article 15 of the Money Laundering Order).</li> </ul> <p>34. Notwithstanding that reliance may be placed on an obliged person, Article 16(10) of the Money Laundering Order states that a relevant person is liable for any failure to apply reliance identification measures.</p> <p>AML/CFT/CPF Code of Practice</p> <p>35. To the extent that reliance is placed on an obliged person, a supervised person must be able to demonstrate that the conditions required by the Money Laundering Order are met.</p> <p>36.

Scrutiny may be considered as two separate, but complimentary processes.</p> <p>13. Firstly, a supervised person monitors all customer transactions and activity to recognise notable transactions or activity, i.e., those that:</p> <ul> <li>are inconsistent with the supervised person's knowledge of the customer (unusual transactions or activity);</li> <li>are complex or unusually large;</li> <li> <p>form part of an unusual pattern; or</p> </li> <li> <p>present a higher risk of money laundering, the financing of terrorism, or the financing of proliferation.</p> </li> </ul> <p>14. Secondly, such notable transactions and activity, including their background and purpose, are then examined by an appropriate person.</p> <p>15. In addition to the scrutiny of transactions as required by the Money Laundering Order, AML/CFT/CPF Codes of Practice in this section also require a supervised person to scrutinise customer activity. This is not just relevant to transaction-based business relationships, but also to business relationships that do not involve transactions, e.g., where a supervised person gives investment advice, or acts as a director to a company.</p> <p>16. A supervised person must therefore, as a part of its scrutiny of transactions/activity, establish appropriate procedures to monitor all its customers' transactions/activity, and to recognise and examine notable transactions/activity.</p> <p>17. Sections 3 and 4 of this Handbook address the capturing of sufficient information about a customer, allowing a supervised person to record a customer business and risk profile which provides a basis for recognising notable transactions/activity, which may indicate money laundering, the financing of terrorism, or the financing of proliferation.</p> <p>18. Additional or more frequent monitoring is required for relationships that have been designated as carrying a higher risk of money laundering, the financing of terrorism, or the financing of proliferation.</p> <p>19. With reference to what has been recorded in the customer business and risk profile, unusual transactions/activity, unusually large transactions/activity, and unusual patterns of transactions/activity may be recognised where transactions or activity are inconsistent with:</p> <ul> <li>the expected pattern of transactions;</li> <li>the expected activity for a particular customer; or</li> <li>the normal business activities for the type of product or service that is being delivered.</li> </ul> <p>20. Where a supervised person's customer base is homogeneous, and where the products and services provided to customers result in uniform patterns of transactions or activity, it may be easier to establish parameters to identify usual transactions/activity. For example, when dealing with local property transactions being passed before the Royal Court or undertaking deposit-taking activities.</p> <p>21. Where each customer is unique, and where the product or service is bespoke, a supervised person will need to tailor monitoring systems to the nature of its business and facilitate the application of additional judgement and experience to the recognition of unusual transactions and activity. This is particularly the case when transactions are being made in VAs.</p> <p>22. For some customers, additional information may only become evident during the course of the business relationship (i.e., whilst acting for the customer ), leading to a revised profile and risk assessment. This requires particular diligence and care when updating documents, data or information and when scrutinising and monitoring customer activity and transactions. In these cases, appropriate staff training in the recognition of unusual transactions and activity is vital, as are relevant systems and controls.</p> <p>23. Higher risk transactions/activity may be recognised by developing a set of 'red flags' or indicators which may indicate money laundering, the financing of terrorism, or the financing of proliferation, based on a supervised person's understanding of its business, products and customers (i.e. the outcome of its BRA -section 2.3.1 of this Handbook ).</p> <p>24. Complex transactions/activity may be recognised by developing a set of indicators, based on a supervised person's understanding of its business, its products and its customers (i.e., the outcome of its BRA -section 2.3.1 of this Handbook ).</p> <p>25. External data sources and media reports may also assist with the identification of notable transactions and activity.</p> <p>26. Where notable transactions or activity are recognised, they will need to be examined. The purpose of this examination is to determine whether there is an apparent economic or visible lawful purpose for the transactions or activity. It is not necessary (nor will it be possible) to conclude with certainty that a transaction or activity has an economic or lawful purpose. Sometimes, it may be possible to make such a determination based on an existing customer business and risk profile and on occasion this examination will involve requesting additional information from a customer.</p> <p>27. Notable transactions or activity may indicate money laundering, the financing of terrorism, or the financing of proliferation where there is no apparent economic or visible lawful purpose for the transaction or activity, i.e., they are no longer just unusual, but may also be suspicious. Reporting of knowledge, suspicion, or reasonable grounds for knowledge or suspicion of money laundering or the financing of terrorism or proliferation financing is addressed in section 8 of this Handbook.</p> <p>28. Practical guidance on financial sanctions implementation matters, including an explanation of reporting obligations under the Sanctions and Asset-Freezing Law, is provided on the JFSC 's website. See also section 8.8 of this Handbook.</p> <p>29. Scrutiny may involve both real time and post event monitoring. Real time monitoring will focus on transactions and activity when information or instructions are received from a customer, before or as the instruction is processed. Post event monitoring may involve end of day, weekly, monthly or annual reviews of customer transactions and activity. Real time monitoring of transactions and activity will more effectively reduce a supervised person's exposure to money laundering, the financing of terrorism, and the financing of proliferation. Post event monitoring may be more effective at identifying unusual patterns.</p> <p>30. Monitoring may involve manual and automated procedures. Automated monitoring procedures may add value to manual procedures by recognising transactions or activity that fall outside set parameters. This will be particularly so where a supervised person processes large volumes of customer transactions which are not subject to day-to-day oversight. However, where automated monitoring procedures are not in place, monitoring is likely to be most effective when undertaken on a case-by-case basis by customer facing staff, administration, and accounts staff, whom may be expected to spot and highlight notable transactions or activity.</p> <p>31. The examination of notable transactions or activity may also be conducted either by customer facing employees, or by an independent reviewer. In any case, the examiner must have access to all customer records.</p> <p>32. The results of an examination should be recorded, and appropriate action taken. Refer to section 10 of this Handbook for record-keeping requirements in relation to the examination of notable transactions and activity.</p> <p>33. To recognise money laundering, the financing of terrorism, and the financing of proliferation, employees will need to have a good level of awareness of each, and to have received training. Refer to section 9 of this Handbook for raising of awareness and training.</p> <p>34. Where on-going monitoring indicates possible money laundering, the financing of terrorism, or the financing of proliferation activity, an internal SAR must be made to the MLRO. Reporting of knowledge, suspicion, or reasonable grounds for knowledge or suspicion, of money laundering, the financing of terrorism, or the financing of proliferation is addressed in section 8 of this Handbook.</p> <p>AML/CFT/CPF Code of Practice</p> <p>35. In addition to the scrutiny of transactions, on-going monitoring must also involve scrutinising activity in respect of a business relationship to ensure that the activity is consistent with the supervised person's knowledge of the customer, including the customer's business and risk profile.</p> <p>36. A supervised person must establish and maintain appropriate and consistent policies and procedures which provide for the identification and scrutiny of:</p> <ul> <li>complex or unusually large activity;</li> <li>unusual patterns of activity, which have no apparent economic or visible lawful purpose; and</li> <li>any other activity, the nature of which causes the supervised person to regard it as particularly likely to be related to money laundering, the financing of terrorism, or the financing of proliferation.</li> </ul> <p>37. As part of its examination of the above transactions, a supervised person must examine, as far as possible, their background and purpose and set forth its findings in writing.</p> <p>Guidance</p> <p>38. A supervised person may demonstrate that CDD policies and procedures are appropriate where scrutiny of transactions and activity has regard to the following factors:</p> <ul> <li>its BRA (including the size and complexity of its business);</li> <li>the nature of its business and services;</li> <li>whether it is practicable to monitor transactions or activity in real time (i.e., before customer instructions are put into effect);</li> <li>whether it is possible to establish appropriate standardised parameters for automated monitoring; and</li> <li>the monitoring procedures that already exist to satisfy other business needs.</li> </ul> <p>39.

A supervised person may demonstrate that CDD policies and procedures are appropriate where the following are used to recognise connections with enhanced risk states, sanctioned countries and territories, and sanctioned persons:</p> <ul> <li>all customers -Business and risk profile in line with section 3.3.5 of this Handbook;</li> <li>all customers -Adopting the sanctions designations lists as a comprehensive listing of sanctions measures applicable in Jersey;</li> <li>all customers -Considering methods of identifying possible indirect associations and connections that may exist between the supervised person's customer and any sanctioned persons and/or enhanced risk states, that will not immediately be obvious from screening of the relevant sanctions designations lists;</li> <li>enhanced risk states -Appendix D1 of this Handbook; and</li> <li>sanctioned countries and territories Appendix D2 of this Handbook (Sources 6 and 12 therein).</li> </ul> <p>57. A supervised person should have appropriate systems and controls (including policies and procedures ) in place to ensure that a change to the UK and UN sanctions designations lists is reviewed and acted upon 'without delay'. This term is defined in FATF 's Best Practices Paper: Targeted Financial Sanctions Related to Terrorism and Terrorist Financing Recommendation 6, on page 9, as meaning 'ideally, within a matter of hours of a designation'. This activity should include a comparison of the supervised person's customer base against the designated persons listed within the sanctions notices.</p> <p>58. A supervised person is encouraged to refer to the FSIU's guidance in terms of the supervised person's unfreezing procedure.</p> <p>59. A supervised person may demonstrate that CDD policies and procedures are appropriate if examination of transactions or activity recognised as being with a person connected with an enhanced risk state includes:</p> <ul> <li>reference to the customer's business and risk profile;</li> <li>as far as possible, a review of the background and purpose of a transaction or activity (set in the context of the business and risk profile); and</li> <li>where necessary, the collection of further information needed to determine whether a transaction or activity has an apparent economic or visible lawful purpose.</li> </ul> <p>60.

Examples of effective sanctions compliance include, but are not limited to:</p> <ul> <li>having appropriate procedures in place to ensure that the content of targeted financial sanctions amendments is reviewed without delay, including screening of customer data against the sanctions designations lists;</li> <li>in the case of an identified positive match, freezing of such accounts, and other funds or economic resources without notice and without delay;</li> <li>refraining from dealing with the funds or assets or making them available (directly or indirectly) to such persons unless licensed by the Minister;</li> <li>sanctions compliance reports required under the Sanctions and Asset-Freezing Law are filed as soon as practicable.</li> </ul> <p>62. A supervised person may wish to undertake their assessment of effectiveness as part of their compliance monitoring plan activities. The assessment may be presented to the board in the form of a report by the MLCO.</p> <p>63. In the context of sanctions compliance reports, 'as soon as practicable' means as soon as possible and practical, considering all of the facts and circumstances in the individual case. For example, obtaining independent legal advice may delay immediate reporting of a sanctions matter and take some time, however, it is reasonable to suggest that the issue will be resolved within a matter of days. In any case, this should be no more than 14 days.</p> <p>64.

Automated monitoring methods may be effective in recognising notable transactions and activity, and business relationships and one-off transactions with persons connected to enhanced risk states, sanctioned countries or territories, or sanctioned persons.</p> <p>66. Exception reports can provide a simple but effective means of monitoring all transactions to, or from, particular geographical locations or accounts, and any activity that falls outside of predetermined parameters, based on thresholds that reflect a customer's business and risk profile.</p> <p>67. Large or more complex supervised persons may also use automated monitoring methods to facilitate the monitoring of significant volumes of transactions, or -such as in an e-commerce environment -where the opportunity for human scrutiny of individual transactions is limited.</p> <p>68. What constitutes unusual behaviour by a customer is often defined by the automated monitoring system selected by the supervised person. It is important that the system selected has an appropriate definition of 'unusual' and is in line with the nature of business conducted by the supervised person.</p> <p>69. Where an automated monitoring method (group or otherwise) is used, a supervised person will need to understand:</p> <ul> <li>how the system works and when it is changed;</li> <li>its coverage (who or what is monitored and what external data sources are used);</li> <li>how to use the system, e.g., making full use of guidance; and</li> <li>the nature of its output (exceptions, alerts etc.).</li> </ul> <p>70. Use of automated monitoring methods does not remove the need for a supervised person to otherwise remain vigilant. Factors such as staff intuition, direct contact with a customer and the ability, through experience, to recognise transactions and activity that do not seem to make sense, cannot be automated.</p> <p>71. In the case of screening of a business relationship (before establishing that relationship and subsequently) and transactions, the use of electronic external data sources to screen customers may be particularly effective. However, where a supervised person uses group screening arrangements, it will need to be satisfied that it provides adequate mitigation of risks applicable to the Jersey business. In all cases, it is important that a supervised person:</p> <ul> <li> <p>understands which business relationships and transaction types are screened;</p> </li> <li> <p>u nderstands the system's capacity for fuzzy matching (a technique used to recognise names that do not precisely match a target name but which are still potentially relevant);</p> </li> <li>sets clear procedures for dealing with potential matches, driven by risk considerations rather than resources; and</li> <li>records the basis for discounting alerts (e.g., false positives) to provide an audit trail.</li> </ul> <p>72. The audit trail should enable a supervised person to review the dates on which screening checks were undertaken and the results of those checks (e.g., the number of false positives), thus allowing them to assess if the system is operating effectively. Where the supervised person is part of a wider group and utilises a group-wide screening system, a written confirmation from its head office may be obtained which confirms that such an audit trail exists and that its records can be accessed upon request.</p> <p>73. By way of example, fuzzy matching arrangements can be used to identify the following variations:</p> <p>74. Further information on screening practices may be found in reports published by the JFSC in August 2014, May 2021. Practical guidance in respect of financial sanctions is also available on the JFSC 's website.</p> Variation Example Different spelling of names. 'Jon' instead of 'John'. 'Abdul' instead of 'Abdel'.

Article 13 of the Money Laundering Order requires a supervised person to apply on-going monitoring throughout the course of a business relationship and take steps to be aware of transactions with heightened money laundering, the financing of terrorism, and the financing of proliferation risks.

This section highlights several general warning signs for supervised persons to help them decide whether there may be reasons for concern, or the basis for a reportable suspicion.</p> <p>77. In relation to on-going monitoring, a supervised person should have regard both to the warning signs contained in the relevant sector-specific sections of this Handbook and the general indicators set out below, where they may become vulnerable to money laundering, the financing of terrorism, or the financing of proliferation. These warning signs apply to on-going relationships just as much as to circumstances that may arise at the start of a business relationship.</p> <p>78.

It also sets out circumstances where simplified identification measures can be applied in relation to low-risk products or services.</p> <p>2. In addition to any case where a supervised person determines that a customer presents a higher risk of money laundering, the financing of terrorism, or proliferation financing, Articles 15, 15A and 15B of the Money Laundering Order also require enhanced CDD measures to be applied in the following specified scenarios:</p> <ul> <li>customer, or some other person, is not physically present for identification purposes -section 7.4 of this Handbook;</li> <li>customer has a relevant connection to an enhanced risk state -section 7.5 of this Handbook;</li> <li>customer, or some other prescribed person, is a PEP -section 7.6 of this Handbook;</li> <li>customer is a non-resident -section 7.7 of this Handbook;</li> <li>customer is provided with private banking services -section 7.8 of this Handbook;</li> <li>customer is a personal asset holding vehicle -section 7.9 of this Handbook;</li> <li>customer is a company with nominee shareholders or issues bearer shares -section 7.10 of this Handbook;</li> <li>correspondent banking or similar relationships -section 7.11 of this Handbook.</li> </ul> <p>3. It may be that CDD measures routinely applied under Article 13 of the Money Laundering Order already address some of the risk characteristics of these customers (for instance identification of beneficial owner(s) and understanding the nature and purpose of the relationship) and significantly reduce the risk of money laundering, the financing of terrorism and proliferation financing. Therefore, any additional measures may be quite limited.</p> <p>4. Nevertheless, the enhanced CDD measures required under Articles 15, 15A and 15B of the Money Laundering Order must be in addition to the measures to be taken in circumstances presenting a lower or standard risk, as set out in sections 4 and 6 of this Handbook and must address the particular risk presented. This section provides some (non-exhaustive) examples for each category of customer.</p> <p>5. When applying enhanced CDD measures, a supervised person should not use a 'one size fits all' -approach, e.g., applying the same package of measures regardless of the circumstances.

Where the existence of foreign PEPs is a practical issue, a supervised person may demonstrate that it has appropriate policies and procedures for determining whether a customer or prescribed person is a PEP where it does the following:</p> <ul> <li>assesses those countries and territories to which customers are connected, which pose the highest risk of corruption. See section 3.3.4.1 of this Handbook;</li> <li>finds out who the current and former holders of prominent public functions are within those higher risk countries and territories and determines, as far as is reasonably practicable, whether customers have any connections with such individuals (including through immediate family or close associates). In determining who the current and former holders of prominent public functions are, it may have regard to information already held by the supervised person and to external information sources such as the UN, the European Parliament, the UK Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office, the Group of States against Corruption, and other external data sources (see section 3.3.4.2 of this Handbook ); and</li> <li>exercises vigilance where customers are involved in business sectors that are vulnerable to corruption such as (but not limited to) oil or arms trades.</li> </ul> <p>59. Where a supervised person runs the details of all its customers and prescribed persons through an external data source (e.g., a screening package) to determine whether any of them are PEPs, it should nevertheless also assess those countries and territories to which customers are connected, which pose the highest risk of corruption, and exercise particular vigilance where customers are involved in business sectors that are vulnerable to corruption.</p> <p>60. Where the customer is a PEP by virtue of their position as a senior executive of a sovereign wealth fund, the supervised person should check if the body is a member of the IFSWF. The IFSWF promotes transparency, good governance, and sound investment practices. Whilst membership of the IFSWF alone cannot guarantee that a sovereign wealth fund or senior executive thereof will act with integrity, the information provided on the IFSWF' s website regarding the sovereign wealth fund may support other CDD measures undertaken.</p> <p>61. In a case where a PEP is a director (or equivalent) of a customer, or person acting or purporting to act for a customer, and where no property of that PEP is handled in the particular business relationship or one-off transaction, a supervised person may demonstrate that it applies specific and adequate measures under Article 15A(2) of the Money Laundering Order where it considers the nature of the PEP 's connection and reason why the PEP has such a connection.</p> <p>62. Similarly, where a PEP is a trustee or a general partner that is a customer or is a beneficiary or object of a power of a trust, and where no property of that PEP is handled in the particular business relationship or one-off transaction, a supervised person may demonstrate that it applies specific and adequate measures under Article 15A(2) of the Money Laundering Order where it considers the nature of the PEP 's connection and reason why the PEP has such a connection.</p> <p>63. For the purposes of declassification, immediate family members, and close associates of foreign PEPs, and prominent persons, should be treated like PEPs.</p> <p>64. A declassification assessment may occur once the relevant time period has passed. The timing of such an assessment, if at all, is at the discretion of the supervised person.</p> <p>65. When a supervised person is considering the declassification of foreign PEPS, and prominent persons, supervised persons might consider the following:</p> <ul> <li>The level of inherent corruption risk in the country of political exposure;</li> <li>The position held and its susceptibility to corruption or misappropriation of state funds or assets;</li> <li>Length of time in office and the likelihood of return to office in the future;</li> <li>The level of transparency about the source of wealth and origin of funds, in particular funds generated while in office;</li> <li>Links to any industries that are high risk for corruption;</li> <li>The overall plausibility of the stated customer profile and net worth;</li> <li>The level of transparency and plausibility of transactions processed through the account;</li> <li>Whether there is relevant adverse information about the customer published in reputable sources; and</li> <li>How politically connected they remain once they have left office.</li> </ul> <p>66. For further guidance on declassifying PEPs supervised persons can refer to the following:</p> <ul> <li>The Wolfsberg Group Guidance; and</li> <li>The FATF Guidance on Recommendation 12 and 22.</li> </ul> <p>Guidance</p> <p>67. In determining whether someone is a domestic PEP, a supervised person should consider the criterion set out at Article 15A(3) of the Money Laundering Order -namely that a PEP is an individual who is or has been entrusted with a prominent public function, for example:</p> <ul> <li>heads of state, heads of government, senior politicians;</li> <li>senior government, judicial or military officials;</li> <li>senior executives of state owned corporations;</li> <li>important political party officials.</li> </ul> <p>68. In the context of Jersey, this will include (but is not limited to) the following positions:</p> <ul> <li>Lieutenant-Governor;</li> <li>Ministers (but not necessarily deputy Ministers);</li> <li>Chief Executive of the States of Jersey;</li> <li>Director-Generals of the States of Jersey;</li> <li>HM Attorney-General;</li> <li>HM Solicitor-General;</li> <li>Commissioners of the JFSC;</li> <li>Director General of the JFSC;</li> <li> <p>Registrar of Companies;</p> </li> <li> <p>Information Commissioner;</p> </li> <li>Comptroller and Auditor-General;</li> <li>Bailiff;</li> <li>Deputy Bailiff;</li> <li>Judicial Greffier;</li> <li>Comptroller of Taxes;</li> <li>HM Receiver General;</li> <li>Senior Executives of State owned Body Corporates (or similar);</li> </ul> <p>69. Note that this will also include immediate family members and close associates of individuals listed above.</p> <p>70. A declassification assessment may occur once the relevant time period has passed. The timing of such an assessment, if at all, is at the discretion of the supervised person.</p> <p>71. When a supervised person is considering the declassification of domestic PEPS, supervised persons might consider the following:</p> <ul> <li>The level of inherent corruption risk in the country of political exposure;</li> <li>The position held and its susceptibility to corruption or misappropriation of state funds or assets;</li> <li>Length of time in office and the likelihood of return to office in the future;</li> <li>The level of transparency about the source of wealth and origin of funds, in particular funds generated while in office;</li> <li>Links to any industries that are high risk for corruption;</li> <li>The overall plausibility of the stated customer profile and net worth;</li> <li>The level of transparency and plausibility of transactions processed through the account;</li> <li>Whether there is relevant adverse information about the customer published in reputable sources; and</li> <li>How politically connected they remain once they have left office.</li> </ul> <p>72.

Under the Money Laundering Order, a supervised person must have procedures in place for reporting such knowledge or suspicion of money laundering or the financing of terrorism activity to the FIU.</p> <p>3.

This section also considers the consent that must be sought from the FIU before proceeding with a transaction or continuing a business relationship, and the application of tipping off provisions.</p> <p>5. An important precondition for making a SAR is to know enough about a business relationship or one-off transaction to be able to recognise what is 'unusual'. Such knowledge is dependent upon the application of identification measures and on-going monitoring.</p> <p>6. A SAR may also be based on information from other sources, including law enforcement agencies, other government bodies, the media, or the customer.</p> <p>7. Whilst this section describes reports made to the FIU under the Proceeds of Crime Law and Terrorism Law as SARs, depending on the circumstances such reports may involve knowledge of money laundering or the financing of terrorism, rather than suspicion (or reasonable grounds for knowledge or suspicion).</p> <p>8.

Legislation deals with reporting by a supervised person and employees in the course of carrying on a supervised business in two ways:</p> <ul> <li>there is a reporting requirement under Article 34D of the Proceeds of Crime Law and Article 21 of the Terrorism Law - a SAR must be made when there is knowledge, suspicion, or reasonable grounds for suspecting that:</li> <li>another person is engaged in money laundering or the financing of terrorism; or</li> <li>any property constitutes or represents proceeds of criminal conduct; or</li> <li>any property has been, is being or is intended to be used in criminal conduct; or</li> <li>any property is or may be terrorist property.</li> <li>there is protection for reporting under Article 32 of the Proceeds of Crime Law and under Article 18 of the Terrorism Law when there is suspicion or belief that any property constitutes or represents:</li> <li>the proceeds of criminal conduct; or</li> <li>property used in or intended to be used in criminal conduct; or</li> <li>terrorist property.</li> <li>Where the person making the report does any act or deals with the property in any way which would otherwise amount to the commission of a money laundering or the financing of terrorism offence, the person shall not be guilty of that offence (where certain conditions are fulfilled in section 8.2.2 of this Handbook ) where it makes a protective report.</li> </ul> <p>10. In practice, a report made in accordance with the reporting requirement will also provide protection. For example, where a supervised person knows or suspects, or has reasonable grounds for knowing or suspecting, that property constitutes or represents the proceeds of criminal conduct (or has been, is being or is intended to be used in criminal conduct), and has possession of that property, it must report its knowledge or suspicion under Article 34D of the Proceeds of Crime Law. Where it makes such a report, this will also address its suspicion or belief that property constitutes or represents the proceeds of criminal conduct (or has been used in or is intended to be used in criminal conduct) under Article 32 of the Proceeds of Crime Law. The effect of this is that the supervised person does not commit a money laundering offence under Article 30 (and potentially Article 31) of the Proceeds of Crime Law.</p> <p>11. Within the Proceeds of Crime Law there is also a reporting requirement (Article 34A) and protection for reporting (Article 32) in a case where a matter or information comes to a supervised person's attention other than in the course of carrying on a supervised business (i.e., through any trade, profession, business, or employment). A similar reporting requirement (and protection ) may also be found in Articles 19 and 18 of the Terrorism Law. This is different to the aforementioned requirement at Article 34D of the Proceeds of Crime Law, where the matter or information comes to a person's attention in the course of carrying on a financial services business (i.e., a supervised business ).</p> <p>12. Whilst the Proceeds of Crime Law and Terrorism Law anticipate that a report may be made by an Employee directly to the FIU, Article 21 of the Money Laundering Order requires that such reporting is made in line with a supervised person's reporting procedures. Such procedures must ensure that a report by an employee is made to the MLRO (or Deputy MLRO ).</p> <p>13. Where the MLRO (or Deputy MLRO ) resolves to make an external SAR as a result of an internal SAR made under the Proceeds of Crime Law or Terrorism Law, Article 21 of the Money Laundering Order requires that SAR to be made using the approved form. In this section 'approved form' means the form approved by the Minister, which may be changed from time to time.</p> <p>14. Where an external SAR is made using the approved form to the FIU, in the circumstances where a supervised person is also subject to the requirements of the EU Legislation (Information Accompanying Transfers of Funds) (Jersey) Regulations 2017 (as amended) and is transacting with group counterparties, an external SAR should also be made in each jurisdiction to which the transaction relates. This external SAR is in addition to any made to the FIU and can be made either by the supervised person, or the group counterparty who was also subject to the same transaction in that jurisdiction.</p> <p>15. A SAR made in respect of a business relationship or one-off transaction does not remove the need to make further reports in respect of knowledge or suspicion that subsequently arises in respect of that business relationship or one-off transaction (which may also be a series of linked transactions).</p>","tags":["section-8"]},{"location":"sections/08-reporting-obligations/#821-requirement-to-report-knowledge-or-suspicion","title":"8.2.1 Requirement to report knowledge or suspicion","text":"<p>16. While carrying on a supervised business, Employees of a supervised person are required to raise an internal SAR as soon as practicable where they have knowledge or suspicion, or where there are reasonable grounds for having knowledge or suspicion that:</p> <ul> <li>another person is engaged in money laundering or the or financing of terrorism; or</li> <li>any property constitutes or represents the proceeds of criminal conduct; or</li> <li>any property has been, is being, or is intended to be used in criminal conduct; or</li> <li>any property is, or may be, terrorist property.</li> </ul> <p>17. What may constitute reasonable grounds for knowledge or suspicion will be determined by the facts or circumstances present, from which an honest and reasonable employee working in a supervised person would have inferred knowledge or formed a suspicion (the socalled 'objective test '). See section 8.2.3.3 of this Handbook.</p> <p>18. Something which appears unusual is not necessarily suspicious but will likely be the cause for further investigation. This may, in turn, require judgement to be exercised as to whether something is indeed suspicious. The provisions under section 8.5 of this Handbook regarding tipping off may also need to be considered.</p> <p>19. A supervised person's MLRO (or Deputy MLRO ) must consider all internal SARs as soon as practicable.</p> <p>20. A supervised person's MLRO (or Deputy MLRO ) is required to make an external SAR as soon as practicable if they know, suspect, or have reasonable grounds for suspecting that:</p> <ul> <li>another person is engaged in money laundering or the financing of terrorism; or</li> <li>any property constitutes or represents the proceeds of criminal conduct; or</li> <li>any property has been, is being, or is intended to be used in criminal conduct; or</li> <li>any property is, or may be, terrorist property.</li> </ul> <p>21. Guidance on how a supervised person may demonstrate that internal and external SARs are being made as soon as reasonably practicable is set out at sections 8.3.1 and 8.3.2 of this Handbook.</p> <p>22. Once an Employee has made an internal SAR, and provided any additional information that may be requested by the MLRO (or Deputy MLRO ), they will have fully satisfied their statutory obligation in respect of the particular matter or information reported.</p> <p>23. Under the Proceeds of Crime Law, the requirement to report applies in relation to the proceeds of such criminal conduct that constitutes an offence specified in Schedule 1 of the Proceeds of Crime Law, or, if it occurs or has occurred outside Jersey, would have constituted such an offence if it occurred in Jersey.</p> <p>24. Under the Terrorism Law, the requirement to report applies in relation to property which is intended or likely to be used for the purposes of terrorism in Jersey or elsewhere, or for the support of a terrorist entity in Jersey or elsewhere.</p> <p>25. Other than in the course of carrying on a supervised business (i.e. any other trade, profession or business carried on by the supervised person ), Employees of a supervised person are also required to raise an internal SAR where they have knowledge or suspicion that another person is engaged in money laundering or the financing of terrorism - where information or a matter on which knowledge or suspicion is based comes to them in the course of their employment. This will apply irrespective of the underlying nature of the business that is carried on, and irrespective of whether the business is being carried out on behalf of another person, e.g., under an outsourcing arrangement.</p> <p>26. Where an MLRO who is part of a group receives information relating to suspicious activities within that group but with no specific Jersey connection, such information is not considered to have come to the MLRO in the course of carrying on a supervised business. This means that such matters, in the absence of a specific Jersey connection, are not required to be reported.</p> <p>Statutory Requirement</p> <p>27. Under Article 34D(4) of the Proceeds of Crime Law, a relevant person and Employees of that relevant person are required to make a report where two conditions are fulfilled.</p> <p>28. The first is that they know, suspect or have reasonable grounds for suspecting that:</p> <ul> <li>another person is engaged in money laundering or the financing of terrorism;</li> <li>any property constitutes or represents the proceeds of criminal conduct; or</li> <li>any property has been, is being or is intended to be used in criminal conduct.</li> </ul> <p>29. The second is that the information or matter on which the knowledge or suspicion is based, or which gives reasonable grounds for suspicion, comes to them in the course of the carrying on of a financial services business.</p> <p>30. Such a report must be made to the FIU (or, in the case of an Employee, to the relevant person's MLRO (or Deputy MLRO)), delivered in good faith, and made as soon as is practicable after the information or other matter on which the knowledge or suspicion is based, or which gives reasonable grounds for suspicion, comes to their attention.</p> <p>31. However, under Article 34D(5) of the Proceeds of Crime Law, a person does not commit an offence if they have a reasonable excuse for not disclosing the information or other matter, or the person is a professional legal adviser and the information or other matter comes to them in the circumstances of legal privilege (except items held with the intention of furthering a criminal purpose).</p> <p>32. Under Article 34D(6) of the Proceeds of Crime Law, an Employee of a relevant person does not commit an offence of failing to disclose if they have not been given material training and, as a result, did not know or suspect that the other person was engaged in money laundering or the financing of terrorism.</p> <p>33. Under Article 34D(9) of the Proceeds of Crime Law, a report made to the FIU (or to the relevant person's MLRO or Deputy MLRO) shall not be treated as a breach of any restriction imposed by statute, contract or otherwise.</p> <p>34. When considering a report made under the Proceeds of Crime Law or Terrorism Law, Article 21(2) and (3) of the Money Laundering Order states that, if the MLRO (or Deputy MLRO) knows or suspects, or has reasonable grounds for knowing or suspecting, that another person is engaged in money laundering or the financing of terrorism, they must report to the FIU as soon as is practicable using the approved form. Among other things, delivery of the approved form must comply with the requirements (including those in respect of delivery) indicated on the approved form.</p> <p>35. Following the submission of a report, Article 21(4) of the Money Laundering Order requires a MLRO (or Deputy MLRO) to provide the FIU (within a set period of time) with such additional information relating to that report as may reasonably be requested.</p> <p>36. A person who fails to make a report under Article 34D of the Proceeds of Crime Law is liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 5 years or to a fine or to both. An individual who fails to make a report using the approved form under Article 21(2) of the Money Laundering Order is liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 2 years or to a fine or to both. A body corporate who fails to make a report using the approved form under Article 21(2) of the Money Laundering Order is liable to a fine.</p> <p>37. Article 34A of the Proceeds of Crime Law contains a similar requirement to report. In a case where a relevant person or employee knows or suspects that another person is engaged in money laundering or the financing of terrorism, and the information or other matter on which that knowledge or suspicion is based comes to their attention in the course of any trade, profession, business or employment (other than carrying on of a financial services business), they must report that knowledge or suspicion and information or other matter to the FIU (or, in the case of an employee, to the relevant person's MLRO (or Deputy MLRO)), in good faith and as soon as is practicable after the information or other matter comes to their attention.</p> <p>38. Under Article 34A(3) of the Proceeds of Crime Law, a report made to the FIU (or to the relevant person's MLRO or Deputy MLRO) under Article 34A shall not be treated as a breach of any restriction imposed by statute, contract or otherwise.</p> <p>39. Article 8 of the Money Laundering Order requires a relevant person to ensure that the MLRO (or Deputy MLRO) has timely access to all records that are necessary or expedient for the purpose of performing his or her functions as a reporting officer, including, in particular, the records that a relevant person must keep under Article 19 of the Money Laundering Order.</p> <p>40. 'Criminal conduct' is defined in Article 1(1) of the Proceeds of Crime Law as conduct that constitutes an offence specified in Schedule 1 of that law, or, if it occurs or has occurred outside Jersey, would have constituted such an offence if occurring in Jersey.</p> <p>41. Articles 19 to 22 of the Terrorism Law contain similar reporting requirements in respect of the financing of terrorism.</p> <p>42. In particular, Article 21 of the Terrorism Law requires a relevant person and Employee of that relevant person to make a report where two conditions are fulfilled.</p> <p>43. The first is that they know, suspect or have reasonable grounds for suspecting that:</p> <ul> <li>another person is engaged in the financing of terrorism; or</li> <li>any property is, or may be, terrorist property.</li> </ul> <p>44. The second is that the information or matter on which the knowledge or suspicion is based, or which gives reasonable grounds for suspicion, comes to them in the course of the carrying on of a financial services business.</p> <p>45. Terrorist property is defined in Article 3 of the Terrorism Law to mean property which is intended to be used, or likely to be used, for the purposes of terrorism or support of a terrorist entity. A terrorist entity is defined in Article 4 as an entity which commits, prepares or instigates an act of terrorism or facilitates the commission, preparation or instigation of an act of terrorism.</p> <p>46.

The test for whether a person holds a suspicion is subjective. The suspicion is one of believing that something is possible, which is more than fanciful. The suspicion must also be more than a vague feeling of unease. If someone thinks a transaction is suspicious, they are not expected to know the exact nature of the criminal offence or that particular funds were definitely those arising from the crime.

There does not have to be evidence that money laundering, terrorist financing, or the financing of proliferation is taking place for there to be a suspicion.</p> <p>71. If someone has not yet formed a suspicion, but they have cause for concern, a supervised person may choose to ask the customer or other parties more questions.

Upon the conviction of a defendant, a court may order the confiscation of their criminal proceeds or the confiscation of assets to a value representing the benefit of their criminal conduct, which may require the realisation of assets which were legitimately obtained. A supervised person may be served with a confiscation order in relation to any funds or property belonging to that defendant. For example, if a person is found to have benefited from drug dealing to a value of \u00a3100,000, then the court may order the confiscation of any assets belonging to that person to a value of \u00a3100,000.

It is a criminal offence to contravene or to intentionally participate in activities knowing that the object or effect of them is to circumvent, to enable, or to facilitate the contravention of any of the prohibitions in respect of Jersey's financial sanctions regimes.</p> <p>144. Jersey 's financial sanctions regimes are rules-based and designed to prevent sanctions breaches. They can relate to all sorts of financial crimes, such as money laundering, the financing of terrorism, the financing of proliferation, bribery, corruption, misappropriation of funds, market abuse etc. Sanctions breaches can lead to a potential prosecution for criminal offences and/or financial penalties and cause reputational damage to the supervised person and to Jersey as an international financial centre.</p> <p>145. Jersey implements both UNSC sanctions and autonomous UK sanctions by implementing the relevant UK Sanctions Regulations through the Targeted Financial Sanctions Measures.</p> <p>146.

Sanctions compliance reporting obligations under the Sanctions and Asset Freezing Law are separate and distinct from any legal obligation to submit a SAR. For example, the Sanctions and Asset Freezing Law requires notification to the Minister concerning suspected financial sanctions breaches, sanctioned persons, and frozen assets. In some circumstances, it may be necessary to submit both reports, i.e., an external SAR to the FIU and a sanctions compliance report to the FSIU.</p> <p>148.

In this section, r eference to a 'person' is a reference to a natural person, as well as a legal person, body or entity.

Under Article 32 of the Sanctions and Asset Freezing Law, a relevant financial institution must inform the Minister as soon as practicable If -</p> <ul> <li>(a) it holds an account of a person, has entered into dealings or an agreement with a person or has been approached by or on behalf of a person;</li> <li>(b) it knows, or has reasonable cause to suspect, that the person;</li> <li> <p>(i) is a designated person; or</p> </li> <li> <p>ii. has committed, is committing or intends to commit an offence under this Law; and</p> </li> <li>(c) the information or other matter on which the knowledge or reasonable cause for suspicion based came to it in the course of carrying on its business.</li> </ul> <p>153. The information given to the Minister must include:</p> <ul> <li>the information or other matter on which the relevant financial institution's knowledge or reasonable cause for suspicion is based;</li> <li>any information that the relevant financial institution holds about the person by which the person can be identified; and</li> <li>if the person is a customer or client of the institution, the nature and amount or quantity of any funds or economic resources held by the institution for the person at the time when the institution first had the knowledge or reasonable cause for suspicion.</li> </ul> <p>154. The Minister retains the power to require additional information and to disclose information under certain conditions.</p> <p>155. By exception, under Article 15 of the Sanctions and Asset Freezing Law, the relevant financial institution may credit frozen accounts in certain circumstances. This activity must be reported to the Minister, as soon as practicable, but in any case, within 14 days.</p> <p>156. Under Article 35(1) of the Sanctions and Asset-Freezing Law, a person commits an offence, and is liable to imprisonment for a term of 12 months and to a fine of level 3 on the standard scale, if the person, without reasonable excuse, refuses or fails within the time and in the manner specified (or, if no time has been specified, within a reasonable time) to comply with sanctions reporting requirements.</p> <p>157. Under Article 35(2) of the Sanctions and Asset Freezing Law, a person commits an offence, and is liable to imprisonment for a term of 2 years and to a fine, if the person: -</p> <ul> <li>(a) knowingly or recklessly gives any information, or produces any document, that is false in a material particular in response to a requirement of sanctions reporting obligations.</li> <li>(b) with intent to evade the reporting provisions, destroys, mutilates, defaces, conceals or removes a document; or</li> <li>otherwise intentionally obstructs the Minister in the exercise of the Minister's powers.</li> </ul> <p>Guidance</p> <p>158. The most common types of financial sanctions include:</p> <ul> <li>targeted asset freezes, which are usually applied to named individuals, entities, and bodies, restricting their access to and ability to use funds and economic resources;</li> <li>restrictions on access to a wide variety of financial markets and services, applicable to named individuals, entities, and bodies, to specified groups or to entire sectors, such as investment bans, restrictions on access to capital markets, directions to cease banking relationships and activities, requirements to notify or seek authorisation before certain payments are made or received, and restrictions on provision of financial, insurance, brokering, advisory services or other financial assistance; and</li> <li>directions to cease all business of a specified type with a specific person, group, sector, territory, or country.</li> </ul> <p>159. Financial sanctions legislation will contain prohibitions on carrying out certain activities or behaving in a certain way where financial sanctions apply. What is prohibited depends on the exact terms of the relevant financial sanctions regime.</p> <p>160. A relevant financial institution should refer to the most up-to-date version of the sanctions legislation imposing the specific financial sanctions that apply in their case, to understand exactly what is prohibited and if there is a breach. We strongly encourage independent advice to be sought if there is any doubt in respect of this point.</p> <p>161. If the financial sanction takes the form of an asset freeze, it is generally prohibited to:</p> <ul> <li>deal with the funds or economic resources belonging to or owned, held, or controlled by a designated person;</li> <li>make funds or economic resources available, directly or indirectly, to, or for the benefit of, a designated person; or</li> <li>engage in actions that directly or indirectly circumvent the financial sanctions.</li> </ul> <p>162. The relevant financial institution, which knows or has a 'reasonable cause to suspect' that it is in possession or control of, or is otherwise dealing with, the funds or economic resources of a designated person, may demonstrate their sanctions reporting compliance by undertaking and documenting the following:</p> <ul> <li>Immediately freeze funds or economic resources without notice and without delay;</li> <li>refrain from dealing with the funds or assets or making them available (directly or indirectly) to such persons unless licensed by the Minister;</li> <li> <p>as soon as practicable, report any findings to the FSIU, together with any additional information that would facilitate compliance with the Sanctions and Asset Freezing Law;</p> </li> <li> <p>provide any further information concerning the frozen assets of designated perso ns, if required. Examples of information to be reported to the Minister may be found in Annex A to the JFSC 's Financial sanctions practical guidance.</p> </li> </ul> <p>163. ' Reasonable cause to suspect ' refers to an objective test that the Court uses to ascertain whether there were factual circumstances from which an honest and reasonable person should have inferred knowledge, or formed the suspicion, of a sanctions breach.</p> <p>164. The requirement to disclose a breach to the Minister 'as soon as practicable ' after discovery of the breach is dependent on the circumstances in each case. Although it is reasonable for a person to take some time to assess the nature and extent of the breach, and/or seek advice, this should not delay an effective response to the breach. A relevant financial institution should demonstrate their decision-making process and document any reason for a reporting delay.</p> <p>165. Where full disclosure is not possible, it is recommended that a relevant financial institution makes an early disclosure with partial information on the basis that it is still working out the facts and will make a further disclosure as soon as possible.</p> <p>166. Sanctions reporting is not generally related to a tipping-off offence since sanctions designations are public. However, there may be circumstances when tipping off provisions may apply, such as when a SAR has been submitted for related suspected money laundering, or the financing of terrorism, or the financing of proliferation.</p> <p>167. The sanctions landscape is constantly changing and evolving. It requires dedicated and qualified staff to ensure that all sanctions designation changes are reviewed and implemented without delay through effective sanctions screening and asset-freezing processes. A relevant financial institution may demonstrate an effective sanctions compliance culture by:</p> <ul> <li>having appropriate policies and procedures and systems and controls in place to ensure that there are dedicated staff assigned to sanction compliance monitoring and reporting;</li> <li>evidencing that relevant training is provided to the assigned employees and to management, including sanctions evasion techniques and identification of sanctions evasion;</li> <li>ensuring that the requisite report is filed in accordance with the legislation relevant to the particular sanctions regime and its guidance;</li> <li>appropriate sanctions reporting record-keeping.</li> </ul> <p>The JFSC and the Government of Jersey provide regular updates on sanctions matters, and deliver sanctions webinars, workshops, and presentations. Further information, including a, description of sanctions regimes in effect in Jersey and their relevant guidance, is available on the JFSC website.

WIRE TRANSFERS","text":"<p>1. The Wire Transfers Regulations were brought into force on 13 June 2017, following the EU's enactment of the EU Regulation on 20 May 2015. It implements FATF Recommendation 16 and promotes an enhanced framework around the traceability of transfers of funds for the purpose of preventing, detecting and investigating money laundering, the financing of terrorism, or the financing of proliferation and other financial crimes.</p> <p>2. The EU Regulation expanded the regulatory requirements with the following objectives:</p> <ul> <li>to prevent the abuse of fund transfers for money laundering, terrorist financing and other financial crime purposes;</li> <li>to detect such abuse should it occur;</li> <li>to support the implementation of restrictive measures; and</li> <li>to allow supervised authorities to access the information promptly.</li> </ul> <p>3. In this section, any reference to a numbered Article, without further detail, is a reference to the Article so numbered inf the EU Regulation.</p> <p>Statutory Requirement</p> <p>4. Regulation 2 of the Wire Transfers Regulations gives the EU Regulation full force and effect, subject to certain adaptations, exceptions and modifications as set out in its Schedule 1.</p> <p>5. Under the Wire Transfer Regulations, the following definitions apply:</p> <p>6. 'money or value transfer service provider' (MVTS) means a person who provides a money or value transfer service within the meaning given in paragraph 5 in Part 2 of Schedule 2 of the Proceeds of Crime (Jersey) Law 1999.</p> <p>7. 'payment service provider' (PSP) means a person, being a person registered under the BB(J) Law, or who is a VASP or a MVTS, when:</p> <p>the person is carrying out payment services in or from within Jersey; or being a legal person established under Jersey law, the person is carrying out payment services in any part of the world other than in or from within Jersey</p> <p>8. 'intermediary payment service provider' (IPSP) means a PSP that is n either that of the payer nor that of the payee and that participates in the execution of transfers of funds;</p> <p>9. 'payer' means a person that is the holder of an account held with a PSP that allows a transfer of funds or value from the account or, where there is no account, a person that places an order for a transfer of funds;</p> <p>10. 'payee' means a person that is the intended final recipient of transferred.</p> <p>11. 'virtual asset\" has the meaning given in Part 1 of Schedule 2 to the law.</p> <p>12. 'virtual asset service provider' (VASP) has the meaning given in Part 4 of Schedule 2 to the law.</p> <p>13. Article 2A(1) of the Wire Transfer Regulations, states that Article 2 of the Wire Regulations shall not apply (and hence the EU Regulations do not apply) to transfers of virtual assets equivalent to less than EUR 1,000.00 if the payer and payee are both VASPs.</p> <p>14. Despite any other stipulation under the EU Regulations, Article 2A(2) of the Wire Transfer Regulations requires that if a payment service provider considers that there is a higher risk of money laundering in respect of virtual assets then it must comply with Article 2 of the Wire Transfer Regulations (and hence the EU Regulations) irrespective of the amount transferred if: - a) the payer is a VASP and the payee is not a VASP; or - b) the payer is not a VASP and the payee is a VASP.</p> <p>Guidance</p> <p>15. The core requirement is that every wire transfer must be accompanied by specific information ( complete information ) about the payer and the payee, which should be collected and retained by payment service provider or intermediary payment institutions, unless special exemptions and derogations apply, including funds transfers between the British Islands (referred in this section as being the UK, Jersey, Guernsey, and the Isle of Man).</p> <p>16. A PSP should establish for each transfer of funds whether it acts as the PSP of the payer, the payee or as an IPSP. This will determine what information must accompany a transfer of funds and the steps required to comply with the Wire Transfer Regulations.</p> <p>17. The Wire Transfer Regulations also require PSPs to put in place effective procedures to detect transfers of funds that lack the required information about the payer and the payee, and to determine whether to execute, reject or suspend such transfers of funds.</p> <p>18. In line with the Data Protection (Jersey) Law 2018, personal data obtained by PSPs should be used only for the purpose of preventing money laundering, terrorist financing, or proliferation financing. PSPs should ensure the confidentiality of such data.</p> <p>19. Any record of information on the payer/payee should not be kept longer than is necessary for the purposes of preventing, detecting, and investigating money laundering, the financing of terrorism, or the financing of proliferation.</p> <p>20. Outside the normal data collection PSPs are expected to record information on the payer or payee. However, Article 2A of the Wire Transfer Regulations gives PSPs an exemption for transfers worth less than a \u20ac 1000.00 between VASPs.</p> <p>21. This exemption falls away if either the payer or payee is not a VASP and the payment is high risk for money laundering. As such, PSPs must apply the EU Regulations as adopted into law, as per Article 2 of the Wire Transfer Regulations.</p> <p>22. The risk factors to be considered are as stated under section 3.3.4.1 of this Handbook, in the cases highlighted at sections 4.4 and 4.5 of this Handbook.</p> <p>23. The JFSC will be issuing a Guidance Note detailing the requirements for proprietary, interentity, Jersey-to-Jersey and inter-group transfers. The Guidance Note will also provide a steer on the suggested approach to the transfer of funds to unregulated VASPs in foreign jurisdictions.</p> <p>24. The JFSC acknowledges that the process of integrating these requirements into a business' practice may take time. Supervision teams would expect that VASPs take reasonable steps towards the implementation of a solution and subsequent compliance with these requirements.</p>","tags":["section-11"]},{"location":"sections/11-wire-transfers/#112-scope-of-the-wire-transfer-regulations","title":"11.2.

If further information (for example, the name and address of the payer) is requested by the PSP of the payee or the IPSP, such information shall be provided by the PSP within three working days;</li> <li>under Article 6, where PSP of the payee is established outside the British Islands, transfers of funds not exceeding \u20ac 1,000 that do not appear to be linked to other transfers of funds which, together with the transfer in question, exceed \u20ac 1 000, shall be accompanied by at least: the names of the payer and the payee and the payment account numbers of the payer and of the payee.</li> </ul> <p>Note: For transfers of funds not exceeding \u20ac 1,000 the PSP of the payer need not verify the information on the payer unless the funds to be transferred have been received in cash or in anonymous electronic money, or the PSP has reasonable grounds for suspecting money laundering or the financing of terrorism.</p> <p>AML/CFT/CPF Code of Practice</p> <p>40. In the case of a payer that is a company, a wire transfer must be accompanied by an address at which the company's business is conducted, or at which it may be contacted. In the case of a payer that is a trustee, a wire transfer must be accompanied by the address of the trustee.</p> <p>Guidance</p> <p>41. Linked transactions are defined as at least those transactions that are sent from the same payment account, or from the same payer to the same payee within a short timeframe, for example, within six months. PSPs and IPSPs may demonstrate that they are able to detect transfers of funds that appear to be linked where they provide, in their policies and procedures, examples of scenarios where transfers are found to be linked which are relevant to their type of business.</p> <p>42. The exemptions for transfers within the British Islands arises from expediency, not principle, in order to accommodate transfers by domestic systems like BACS which are currently unable to include complete information. Accordingly, where the system used for a transfer within the British Islands has the functionality to carry complete information, it is considered a good practice to include it, and thereby reduce the likely incidence of inbound requests from payee PSPs for complete information.</p> <p>43. The verification requirement set out in the Wire Transfer Regulations will be met for an account holding customer of a PSP where the payer's identity has already been verified by CDD measures and is stored, in accordance with the Money Laundering Order.</p> <p>44. To meet the technical limitations and to manage cases with multiple account holders and different addresses, the PSP of the payer may demonstrate compliance with the Wire Transfer Regulations by documenting the priority given to the payer's information in line with law enforcement purposes to trace the payer and for sanctions screening. For example, by de-prioritising titles and full middle names, whilst prioritising the initial of the given name and the full family name and at least the country and the city of address; or for joint accounts holders to provide both names, giving priority to family name over given names.</p>","tags":["section-11"]},{"location":"sections/11-wire-transfers/#1132-batch-files-payments-either-inside-or-outside-of-british-islands","title":"11.3.2.

To address the potential risk presented by such transfers, PSPs of the payee should put in place the following measures, ensuring they are commensurate with and proportionate to the money laundering and terrorist financing risks to which the PSP or IPSP are exposed: - effective systems and controls to detect transfers of funds that lack required information; and - risk-based policies and procedures to determine whether to execute, reject or suspend a transfer of funds that lacks the required information. 50. Effective policies and procedures should be set up in a way that reflects the adoption of a risk-based approach and should clearly document the following aspects:</p> <ul> <li>which information relating to transfers of funds has to be recorded, how this information should be recorded, and where it is stored;</li> <li>which transfers of funds have to be monitored in real time and which transfers of funds can be monitored on an ex-post basis, and why;</li> <li>the obligations of members of staff where they detect missing or incomplete information and the processes they should follow.</li> </ul> <p>51.

This section is supplemental to and should be read in conjunction with the sections of this Handbook referenced in the text below.</p> <p>2. The purpose of this section is to assist with the application of CDD, the conduct of risk assessments and additional AML/CFT/CPF requirements by funds, securities issuers and their service providers. The definition of financial services business in the Proceeds of Crime Law means that:</p> <ul> <li>(a) regulated and prudentially supervised funds and fund service providers under the CIF(J) Law and the FS(J) Law;</li> <li>(b) funds that are not regulated (such as unregulated funds under the Collective Investment Funds (Unregulated Funds) (Jersey) Order 2008 and private funds) and their service providers; and</li> <li>(c) other securities issuers and their service providers,</li> </ul> <p>are subject to the same statutory requirements in the Money Laundering Order. Further guidance is available in sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3 and 3.12 of the Guidelines.</p> <p>3. The types of funds, securities issuers and their service providers to which this section applies are described in the Guidelines. For the purposes of this section references to a fund include all sub funds and constituent parts of the fund</p> <p>4. It should also be noted that funds, securities issuers and their service providers might be conducting other types of financial services business, e.g., a service provider that is a trustee to a fund will also be a TCSP for the purposes of Schedule 2 of the Proceeds of Crime Law.</p> <p>5. Every supervised person has obligations pursuant to the Money Laundering Order. Where there are several different service providers involved in a fund or securities issuer structure their respective CDD obligations and subsequent CDD measures applied may differ. The differences may be attributable to different roles, risk appetites and risk assessments, which will determine how they fulfil their AML/CFT/CPF obligations.</p> <p>6. The service providers of funds or securities issuers can include all those entities and activities listed in Schedule 2, Part 2, paragraph 9 of the Proceeds of Crime Law. The list below provides some examples of roles that supervised persons may hold with a fund or securities issuer as their customer. As noted in paragraph 5 above, different supervised persons may have varying CDD obligations based on the type of service they provide to a Fund:</p> <ul> <li>Auditor;</li> <li>Administrator/Registrar;</li> <li>Manager;</li> <li>Investment Adviser;</li> <li>Lender;</li> <li>Class G Director;</li> <li>Asset Manager;</li> <li> <p>Distributor;</p> </li> <li> <p>Custodian;</p> </li> <li>Legal Adviser.</li> </ul> <p>7. Natural Persons such as Class G Directors regulated under the FS(J) Law are supervised persons and will also have AML/CFT/CPF obligations. The JFSC has produced the Guidance note Natural persons carrying on a single class of trust company business for these individuals.</p> <p>8. An entity that is a Managed Entity (meaning an entity that is managed by a Manager of a Managed Entity registered to carry on class ZK of fund services business under the FS(J) Law has the same AML/CFT/CPF obligations as any other Fund Operator. The JFSC has produced a Guidance note: Manager of managed entity (MoME) and certain managed entities.</p> <p>9. Funds, securities issuers, and their service providers may have different AML/CFT/CPF obligations. For example, any one of the service providers in the list above may be neither a Jersey legal person or arrangement nor carrying on business in or from within Jersey and so will not be a supervised person and will not be subject to Jersey AML/CFT/CPF obligations. A fund, securities issuer and/or their service provider that is not a supervised person may have AML/CFT/CPF obligations in another jurisdiction. A non-Jersey service provider that is not subject to Jersey AML/CFT/CPF obligations may act for a Jersey fund, such as a Jersey fund company, that does have Jersey AML/CFT/CPF obligations.

To meet its AML/CFT/CPF obligations, a supervised person is required to prepare a BRA, along with a CRA for each of its customers.

The BRA and CRA may be completed differently based on what the supervised person is/does, for example:</p> <p>11. All the financial services businesses defined by the Proceeds of Crime Law that are supervised persons under the Money Laundering Order must conduct a BRA and individual CRAs.

When preparing a BRA or CRA, factors in this operational business risk assessment may be relevant. Therefore, a combined BRA and operational business risk assessment may be appropriate.</p> <p>13. Risks that are not normally considered to be AML/CFT/CPF -specific may also be relevant to a BRA, for example, credit risk, tax risk, investor eligibility risk, cyber security related risk etc.</p> <p>14. It is common practice for a securities issuer to outsource the conduct of its BRA to an administrator. In such circumstances, the administrator will also need to conduct a CRA on the securities issuer (its customer ) as it has two separate roles - acting both for itself (conducting a BRA on itself and CRA on the securities issuer) and as delegate for the securities issuer (conducting a BRA and CRA on behalf of the securities issuer).

Unit trusts differ from traditional private trusts.

Beneficiaries may be expressly referred to or may form part of a class and may not have a vested right to the trust assets.</p> <p>60. In a unit trust the promoter or instigator may fund the establishment of the unit trust and may fund the initial investment, thus being considered a settlor.

Identification of investors in a securities issuer will be approached differently by the securities issuer and the securities issuer service provider.</p> <p>63. The securities issuer has an obligation to identify each of its investors, as they are the securities issuer 's customers. This obligation exists regardless of whether they are passive investors who do not exercise control over the securities issuer.</p> <p>64. The securities issuer service provider, however, has an obligation to identify the Beneficial owners and/or controllers of their customer (the securities issuer) and should apply the Three Tier Test to ascertain who the Beneficial owners and/or controllers are. Where ownership of a securities issuer is distributed widely, it may be that none of the investors control the securities issuer through their ownership. In such a case, these 'passive' investors are not Beneficial owners at Tier 1 and, assuming they are not controllers via Tier 2 or 3, a securities issuer service provider need not apply identification measures to them.</p> <p>65. It should be noted, however, that to demonstrate that sufficient information has been collected on source of funds for a customer relationship, it may still be necessary to consider the provenance of investors who have a material interest in a customer, but who do not also exercise control. The effect of this may still be to require information to be obtained on such passive investors (though it may not be necessary to also obtain evidence of identity).</p> <p>66. For example, an investment advisor giving advice directly to a regulated fund with passive investors will still need to obtain source of funds information in relation to those investors to understand the AML/CFT/CPF risk posed by its customer.</p> <p>67. The extent of source of funds information collected will be proportionate to the risks identified and determined on a case-by-case basis. In a lower risk relationship, source of funds information should be obtained for all passive investors with a holding of 25% or more. Where there are no 25%+ holders, generic investor information on source of funds such as a generic profile could be obtained. In a higher risk relationship, more stringent measures should be applied. These measures should be determined on a case-by-case basis with reference to the supervised person's CRA of the relationship.</p> <p>68. Similarly, to demonstrate that sufficient information has been collected to assess the AML/CFT/CPF risks posed by a customer, it may be necessary to consider the identity, nature, structure and location of investors who have a material interest in a customer, but who do not also exercise control.

In addition, a promoter may also be a Beneficial owner and/or controller where the board of a securities issuer does not exercise sufficient effective control.

Articles 17B-D of the Money Laundering Order do apply to third parties which would encompass the investors in a limited partnership or a unit trust.</p> <p>116. Article 18(4)(b) of the Money Laundering Order refers to a customer that is a body corporate or limited liability company whose securities are listed on an IOSCO compliant exchange or on a regulated market. As part of the assessment whether simplified CDD may be applied, the supervised person should consider whether the exchange on which the securities are listed is an IOSCO compliant exchange or a regulated market. The fact that the exchange is listed in a product guide (e.g., Listed Fund Guide) or in an Order (e.g., the Collective Investment Funds (Unregulated Funds) (Jersey) Order 2008) does not necessarily mean it qualifies.

An administrator may be acting in two capacities when undertaking CDD;</p> <ul> <li>for itself as securities issuer service provider and</li> <li>as a delegate on behalf of the securities issuer. In such a case, a supervised person seeking to rely on CDD undertaken by the administrator needs to be clear whether it is the administrator or the securities issuer that is the obliged person.</li> </ul> <p>119.

Contractual arrangements may be put in place where another entity undertakes CDD for the supervised person as a delegate. This is likely to be the case where an administrator and/or manager is appointed to the securities issuer or where the Governing body of the securities issuer such as a trustee or general partner is a managed entity and reliant on a manager of a managed entity. The supervised person always remains responsible for fulfilling its statutory obligations regardless of the activities it outsources to delegates.</p> <p>129.

The supervised person would be expected to ensure that the terms are adequate to ensure a clear understanding of what activity the delegate is undertaking.</p> <p>131. Given that the delegate carrying out the outsourced function is likely to have its own CDD obligations it will be important to distinguish between measures applied on behalf of the delegating party and measures applied for itself. This will ensure the respective (and potentially differing) obligations are met and will assist if the delegating party moves to another securities issuer service provider and wishes to take its information/documentation/records with it.</p> <p>132. Section 2.4.4 of this Handbook provides a table of activities which may be outsourced but also states that CDD is always the responsibility of the supervised person.</p> <p>133.

Where a securities issuer service provider assesses the AML/CFT/CPF risk regarding a securities issuer to be higher or the securities issuer/securities issuer service providers are not regulated, the application of exemptions from identification measures is prohibited. Therefore, a securities issuer service provider providing services to a securities issuer where it has no direct relationship with the investors may need to apply identification measures to the investors. This may be in relation to the control of the securities issuer or its source of funds. Rather than gathering this information themselves they will instead seek access to this information which will normally already have been provided to the securities issuer by investors via subscription agreements/investor questionnaires.</p> <p>135. Note that specific provisions may be necessary in subscription agreements/investor questionnaires to enable the securities issuer to pass on information and evidence that it obtains to meet its own AML/CFT/CPF obligations, to assist securities issuer service providers (present and future) involved in the securities issuer/securities issuer structure to meet their own AML/CFT/CPF obligations (subject to any data protection requirements).</p>","tags":["section-13"]},{"location":"sections/13-fund-services/#1385-amlsp","title":"13.8.5 AMLSP","text":"<p>136.

Any business that accepts cash or VA over the \u20ac15,000 threshold for relevant transactions is required to register as a high value dealer.

Some businesses may decide that they will simply not accept payments over the threshold amount.

Serious organised criminals frequently launder cash through legitimate and quasi legitimate businesses, typically those with a high cash turnover.

When winding up an estate, there is no blanket requirement that supervised persons should be satisfied about the history of all the funds which make up the estate under administration.

If the deceased person is from another jurisdiction and a Lawyer is dealing with the matter in the home country, supervised persons may find it helpful to ask the Lawyer for information about the deceased to gain some assurances that there are no suspicious circumstances surrounding the estate.

Criminal conduct generates huge amounts of illicit capital, and these criminal proceeds need to be integrated into personal lifestyles and business operations. Law enforcement agencies have advised that property purchases are one of the most frequently identified methods of money laundering. Property can be used either as a vehicle for money laundering or as a means of investing laundered funds.</p> <p>29.

The purchase of real estate is commonly used as part of the last stage of money laundering. Such a purchase offers the criminal an investment which gives the appearance of financial stability. The purchase of a restaurant or hotel, for example, offers advantages as it is often a cash-intensive business, which is the preferred currency of criminals. Cash remains the mainstay of much serious organised criminal activity.

Conveyancing is a comparatively easy and efficient method of laundering money with relatively large amounts of criminal monies 'cleaned' in one transaction. In a stable or rising property market, the money launderer will incur no financial loss except fees. Conveyancing transactions can also be attractive to money launderers who are attempting to disguise the audit trail of the proceeds of their crimes.

Corrupt Lawyers may employ trainees to perform the conveyancing work for criminal groups, thereby distancing themselves from the criminal aspect of the business. Conveyancers should also be alert to instructions which are a deliberate attempt to avoid assets being dealt with in the way intended by the court or through the usual legal process.

Lawyers should expect to be updated if those details change, for example, if a mortgage falls through and new funding is obtained.</p> <p>37. Supervised persons should remember that payments made through the mainstream banking system are not guaranteed to be clean.</p> <p>38. Transactions that do not involve a mortgage or are not being financed wholly from the sale of a previous property have a higher risk of being fraudulent. Supervised persons should be alert for large payments from such private sources of funds, especially if the customer receives payments from several individuals or sources.

Transactions which a re not at arm's length may warrant particular consideration. However, until the improperly obtained mortgage advance is received, there is not any criminal property for the purposes of disclosure obligations to the FIU.</p> <p>45. If a supervised person suspects that a customer is making a misrepresentation to a mortgage lender, the supervised person must either dissuade them from doing so or consider the ethical implications of continuing with the retainer. Even if a supervised person no longer acts for the customer, it may still be under a duty to advise the mortgage lender.</p> <p>46. Large scale mortgage fraud is more sophisticated and will normally involve several properties. It may be committed by criminal groups or by individuals. The buy-to-let market is particularly vulnerable to large scale mortgage fraud, whether through new-build apartment complexes or large-scale renovation properties. Occasionally commercial properties will be involved.</p> <p>47. Fraudsters may use private sources of funding such as property clubs, especially when credit market conditions tighten. These lenders often have lower safeguards than institutional lenders, leaving them vulnerable to organised fraud.

Increasingly, of fshore companies are used with the property sold several times within the group before approaching a lender for a mortgage at an inflated value.</p> <p>49.

If a customer has made a deliberate misrepresentation on their mortgage application, it is likely that the crime/fraud exemption to legal professional privilege will apply (see section 15.5.1 of this Handbook ).

The nature of company structures can make them attractive to money launderers because it is possible to obscure true ownership and protect assets for relatively little expense. For this reason, Lawyers working with companies and in commercial transactions should remain alert throughout their business relationships, with existing as well as new customers.</p> <p>53. A common operating method amongst serious organised criminals is the use of front companies. These are often used to disguise criminal proceeds as representing the legitimate profits of fictitious business activities. They can also help to make the transportation of suspicious cargoes appear as genuine goods being traded. Often, they are used to mask the identity of the true beneficial owners and the source of criminally obtained assets. Corporate vehicles are also frequently used to help commit tax fraud, facilitate bribery/corruption, shield assets from creditors, facilitate fraud generally or circumvent disclosure requirements.</p> <p>54. The lack of transparency concerning the Beneficial ownership and control of corporate vehicles has proved to be a consistent problem for money laundering investigations. Corporations acting as directors and nominee directors can be used to conceal the identity of the natural persons who manage and control a corporate vehicle.</p> <p>55. Several international reports have highlighted the extent to which private limited companies, shell companies, bearer shares, nominees, front companies, and SPVs have been used in money laundering operations.

Further enquiries by auditors","text":"<p>75. This section is supplemental to and should be read in conjunction with section 8.2 of this Handbook (Reporting knowledge or suspicion).</p> <p>76. Section 8.2 of this Handbook states that there is a reporting requirement under Article 34D of the Proceeds of Crime Law and Article 21 of the Terrorism Law to make a SAR when there is knowledge, suspicion or reasonable grounds for suspecting that:</p> <ul> <li>another person is engaged in money laundering or the financing of terrorism; or</li> <li>any property constitutes or represents proceeds of criminal conduct; or</li> <li>any property has been, is being or is intended to be used in criminal conduct; or</li> <li>any property is or may be terrorist property.</li> </ul> <p>77. Once an auditor suspects a possible breach of legislation which may require a report under the laws referenced above, further enquiries will need to be made. Auditing standards require that when the auditor becomes aware of information concerning a possible breach, the auditor should obtain an understanding of the nature of the act and the circumstances in which it has occurred. Sufficient information should be obtained to evaluate the possible effect on the customer's financial statements.</p> <p>78. However, the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Legislation does not require an auditor to undertake any additional enquiries to determine further details of the predicate criminal offence (i.e., the offence giving rise to the proceeds of crime). To help mitigate the risk of tipping-off, it is important that any further enquiries only represent steps that the auditor would have performed as part of the normal audit work and that the MLRO (or Deputy MLRO ) is consulted before any further enquiry is performed. If an employee of the auditor is genuinely uncertain as to whether there are grounds to make a SAR, they may wish to seek advice from their MLRO (or Deputy MLRO ).</p> <p>79. During the course of the audit work, the auditor might obtain knowledge or form a suspicion about a proposed act that would be a criminal offence but has yet to occur. Because attempting or conspiring to commit a money laundering offence is itself a criminal act, a SAR may need to be made in some circumstances.</p> <p>80. Where the auditor makes an internal SAR to the MLRO (or Deputy MLRO ) and it is decided that further enquiry is necessary, the auditor will need to be made aware of the outcome of the enquiry to determine whether there are any implications for the audit report or the decision to accept reappointment as auditor.</p> <p>81. The auditor will need to consider whether continuing to act for the customer could itself constitute a money laundering offence. For example, if it amounted to aiding or abetting the commission of one of the principal money laundering offences such as becoming involved in an arrangement. In those circumstances the auditor may wish to consider resigning but should first contact their MLRO (or Deputy MLRO ) to report the suspicion and seek guidance in respect of tipping-off. If the auditor wishes to continue to conduct the audit, appropriate consent may be required from the FIU.</p> <p>82.

Auditor' s responsibility for monitoring compliance","text":"<p>Accountants</p> <p>83. The International Standard on Auditing's Policy Paper ISA 250 establishes standards and provides guidance on the auditor's responsibility to consider legislation in an audit of financial statements. The Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Legislation does not require the auditor to extend the scope of an audit except as set out in section 16.7.3 of this Handbook, but regular audit work could still give rise to knowledge or suspicion, or reasonable grounds for knowledge or suspicion, that will need to be reported. Such knowledge or suspicion may arise in relation to:</p> <ul> <li>legislation linked directly to the preparation of the financial statements;</li> <li> <p>legislation which provides a legal framework within which the customer conducts its business; and</p> </li> <li> <p>other legislation.</p> </li> </ul> <p>84. Auditing standards relating to legislation require the auditor to obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding compliance with the legislation that has an effect on the determination of material amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. This may result in the auditor becoming suspicious that, for example, fraud or tax offences have taken place, which may be criminal offences resulting in the acquisition of criminal property.</p> <p>85. Auditing standards on legislation also require the auditor to carry out procedures to help identify possible or actual instances of non-compliance with the legislation which provides a legal framework within which the customer conducts its business and is therefore central to its financial statements. These procedures involve:</p> <ul> <li>obtaining a general understanding of the legal and regulatory framework applicable to the customer and its wider industry, and of the procedures followed to ensure compliance with that framework;</li> <li>inspecting correspondence with the relevant licensing and regulatory authorities;</li> <li>making enquiries to the Board/senior management of the customer as to whether they are on notice of any such possible instances of non-compliance with those laws or regulations; and</li> <li>obtaining written representation that the Board/senior management have disclosed to the auditor all known actual or possible instances of non-compliance with legislation whose effects should be considered when preparing financial statements, together with - where applicable - the actual or contingent consequences which may arise from the non-compliance (i.e., regulatory fines, public censure etc).</li> </ul> <p>86. This work may give the auditor grounds to suspect that criminal offences have been committed and which may need to be reported to the FIU.</p> <p>87. If the customer falls within the definition of a financial services business, legislation relating to money laundering will be central to the operation of their business. When auditing the financial statements of such customers, the auditor must review the steps taken by the customer to comply with the Money Laundering Order and the JFSC's other regulatory requirements, assess their effectiveness and obtain board/senior management representations concerning compliance with them. If the customer's systems and controls (including policies and procedures ) appear to be ineffective, the auditor must consider whether there is an obligation to report a matter of 'material significance' to the JFSC and the possible impact of any regulatory action which may arise from the same (see section 16.7.3 of this Handbook for further information).</p> <p>88. The auditor will need to consider whether any contingent liabilities may arise in this area. For example, there may be criminal fines for non-compliance with the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Legislation. In certain circumstances, civil claims or confiscation proceedings may occur, giving rise to contingent liabilities. The auditor will also need to remain alert to the fact that discussions with the customer on such matters may create a risk of tipping off (see section 8.5 of this Handbook ).</p> <p>89. In some situations, the auditor's customer may have obtained legal advice to the effect that certain actions or circumstances do not give rise to criminal conduct and therefore cannot give rise to criminal property. Determining whether an act constitutes non-compliance with the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Legislation may involve consideration of matters which do not lie within the competence and experience of the auditor. As a result, provided that the auditor considers that the advice has been obtained from a suitably qualified and independent Lawyer and the Lawyer was made aware of all relevant circumstances known to the auditor, then the auditor may rely on such advice, provided the auditor has complied with auditing standards on using the work of an expert.</p>","tags":["section-16"]},{"location":"sections/16-accountants/#1673-reporting-to-regulators","title":"16.7.3.

It is important to confine enquiries to those required in the ordinary course of business and not attempt to further investigate a matter reported upon, unless this is within the scope of the professional work commissioned.</p> <p>92. In more complex circumstances, consultation with the FIU may be necessary before enquiries are continued. It should be noted that neither the FIU nor other law enforcement agencies may give consent to tipping-off.</p> <p>93. Supervised persons carrying on audit business may wish to engage their MLRO/Deputy MLRO or another suitable specialist (for example a Lawyer ) if there are tipping-off concerns. In particular, it is important that before any document referring to the subject matter of a SAR is released to a third party, the MLRO (or Deputy MLRO ) is consulted along with, where necessary, law enforcement.

An auditor may wish to resign if it is believed that the customer or an employee of the customer is engaged in money laundering, the financing of terrorism, or the financing of proliferation, or any other illegal act, particularly where a normal relationship of trust can no longer be maintained.

Prescribed Non-Profit Organisations ( Prescribed NPOs ) are supervised persons under Article 1 of the Supervisory Bodies Law. They are therefore subject to supervision by the JFSC for compliance with the Prescribed NPO Order.</p> <p>3. Prescribed NPOs is a sub-section of the non-profit sector which has been identified as being at a heightened risk and vulnerability of being abused for terrorist financing purposes.</p> <p>4. Article 1 of the Prescribed NPO Order advises that a NPO will be considered a Prescribed NPO where, during the preceding 12 months it has:</p> <ul> <li>raised NPO Funds exceeding \u00a31,000 from outside Jersey, Guernsey, the Isle of Man, England and Wales and Scotland, or</li> <li>disbursed NPO Funds exceeding \u00a31,000 outside those jurisdictions.</li> </ul> <p>5. The JFSC will apply a risk-based approach to determine how a Prescribed NPO is supervised for compliance with the Prescribed NPO Order and section 17 of the Handbook. See the NPO section of our website for more details.</p> <p>6. Prescribed NPOs are required by the Prescribed NPO Order to:</p> <ul> <li>prepare an annual financial statement, and make it available to the JFSC upon request;</li> <li>have appropriate systems and controls to ensure that NPO Funds are fully accounted for;</li> <li>keep records of NPO Owners and/or Controllers;</li> <li>keep records of significant donors; and</li> <li>take reasonable steps to identify, obtain information on, and confirm that its associate NPOs and NPO Beneficiaries are not assisting, or being used to assist, terrorist activities.</li> </ul> <p>7.

The April 2022 the National Risk Assessment for NPOs (the NPO NRA ) identified around 11% of Jersey-based NPOs as being particularly vulnerable to being abused for terrorist financing purposes.</p> <p>13. This sub-sector of NPOs may be more vulnerable to terrorist financing abuse due to one or more of the following factors:</p> <ul> <li>operating in higher-risk jurisdictions, such as conflict zones, failed states and disaster areas, where support such as humanitarian aid and disaster relief is desperately needed, and which equally are areas where terrorists also are known to undertake activities;</li> <li>using associate NPOs;</li> <li>using money remittance methods, such as Hawala and cash, which may render the tracing of funds to legitimate NPO Beneficiaries more challenging.</li> </ul> <p>14. Diversion is the principal way in which NPOs may be abused for terrorist financing. The Glossary of the Handbook defines Diversion as ' transactions by NPO Representatives or external parties such as associate NPOs that divert funds away from the NPO's legitimately intended purposes to a terrorist, terrorist cell or terrorist organisation for them to benefit from, directly or indirectly'.</p> <p>15. Examples of how Diversion may take place include:</p> <ul> <li>terrorists posing as legitimate NPO Beneficiaries to benefit from NPO programmes, such as receiving NPO Funds;</li> <li>terrorists appearing to act as ordinary associate NPOs, at the same time as abusing NPO Resources by diverting NPO Funds to support their activities.</li> </ul> <p>16. Diversion risk may increase where a NPO:</p> <ul> <li>does not properly invest in its terrorist financing risk control framework on grounds of cost;</li> <li>is too focused on assisting NPO Beneficiaries at the expense of accountability or effective risk management;</li> <li>has a high-risk appetite, and a low level of terrorist financing risk controls;</li> <li>takes the view that if no incidents are reported, or that the diverted value is small, the risk of terrorist financing abuse is negligible. It is worth reflecting that even when utilising small amounts, a bad actor can cause great harm. For example, the cost of assembling a dangerous homemade explosive device can require only a relatively small amount of funds.</li> </ul> <p>17. Diversion risk can also increase where a NPO does not adequately manage ' Transfer risk ', - i.e., the risk that Diversion will take place where funds are transferred to associate NPOs. High-quality associate NPOs can reduce terrorist financing risk, with their local knowledge and relationships providing an additional level of information and control to the NPO. However, poor due diligence can increase the terrorist financing risk. Some associate NPOs may be sympathetic to, infiltrated by, or under the control of, terrorist elements. Alternatively, they may not have strong terrorist financing controls and may inadvertently finance terrorist activities. 18. Ceding control of funds does not cede responsibility for their destination. Associate NPO selection, due diligence and oversight forms a crucial part of responsible NPO activity.</p> <p>19. The offence of terrorist financing is broad in nature and scope.

A risk-based approach is not intended to prevent or obstruct aid from reaching legitimate NPO Beneficiaries. It is a way of ensuring it reaches them in the safest way.

Robust controls provide confidence to donors, Financial Institutions, such as banks, and the regulator. It can also mitigate civil litigation from donors.</p> <p>27. A risk-based approach can be established through the completion of a NPO programme risk assessment ( NPO PRA ).

Whilst it is the responsibility of each Prescribed NPO to identify and define their NPO programme(s) of activity, examples may include:</p> <ul> <li>the delivery of food parcels to rural communities in X country;</li> <li>providing emergency shelters and supplies to victims of an earthquake and tsunami in Y country;</li> <li>funding of an animal shelter in Z country.</li> </ul> <p>29. A Prescribed NPO may consider it appropriate to conduct a separate risk assessment for each NPO programme of activity undertaken. This might be appropriate where only one NPO programme of activity is conducted at a time.</p> <p>30. Where a Prescribed NPO undertakes a large number of NPO programmes simultaneously, e.g., aid operations in multiple countries, it may be more suitable to conduct one NPO PRA for the whole body of work conducted.</p> <p>31. A NPO PRA should be reviewed at any point where there is a perceived change in the risk profile of the NPO programme(s) which have been assessed (e.g., if civil unrest develops in the region where the NPO programme is taking place)</p> <p>32. The NPO PRA should have regard to all relevant risk factors. These may include, but are not limited to:</p> <ul> <li>the nature, scale, complexity and the diversity of its operations (including geographical diversity), the volume and size of its transactions, and the degree of risk associated with each area of its operation;</li> <li>jurisdictions, territories or areas where it is not uncommon that terrorist organisations may demand that people they direct should be involved in a NPO programme, for example where the terrorists may be political actors, or where terrorists otherwise control the area;</li> <li>operating in environments where gifts form part of cultural interactions, and where terrorist organisations may exert pressure to comply with such donations;</li> <li>operating in environments where taxes and fees are collected by terrorist organisations or their Sympathisers, and where this is a known and regular occurrence;</li> <li>location remoteness and intensity of local conflict and factions, potentially intensified by legitimate security and policing forces not having a presence;</li> <li>carrying out distribution work in jurisdictions, territories or areas that are controlled by terrorist organisations where the NPO may be directed or demanded to provide aid to certain parties;</li> <li>the characteristics of activities and services the NPO offers, and the associated vulnerabilities posed by each activity and service;</li> <li>any degree of third party involvement in the NPO programme, including, for example, using associate NPOs;</li> <li>jurisdictions, territories or areas where NPOs require the support of local associate NPOs to be able to operate safely and where terrorist organisations have political support and influence;</li> <li>circumstances where it is difficult to adequately screen a person's background or establish their associates;</li> <li>any risk presented by the Prescribed NPO 's donors or NPO Beneficiaries;</li> <li>any risk presented by the technology utilised by the Prescribed NPO, including communications channels, fund-raising platforms and payment mechanisms;</li> <li>being the target of a cyber-attack, such as through phishing. An example of a cyber-attack might be where an attacker sends an e-mail to the Prescribed NPO, pretending to be from one of their suppliers. The e-mail includes an invoice and states that the supplier has changed their bank and requires the NPO to amend the account details of where to send payments. The invoice has been doctored and the new account details are those of the attacker. The money is then transferred directly to the attacker, potentially for the benefit of terrorists.</li> </ul> <p>33. When conducting a NPO PRA care should be taken not to focus too much on any single factor. All aspects of the political, economic, geographical, technological, social and sanction risk environment in the area of the NPO 's operations should be considered. Prescribed NPOs should also take into account any risks identified by a NPO NRA, or similar documents.</p> <p>34. Risk should also be considered on a cumulative basis. The overall exposure from all risks aggregated together may be greater than if they were each considered individually.</p> <p>35. An example of a NPO PRA checklist can be downloaded from our website and modified, as appropriate: draft programme risk assessment checklist. This template is not intended to be rigid or prescriptive. An NPO may wish to make amendments to the checklist to account for the specific risks relevant to its activities.</p> <p>36. To support the assessment of risks presented by a particular NPO programme of work, it may be appropriate to prepare a risk appetite statement. This statement sets out what level of terrorist financing risk the Prescribed NPO is prepared to tolerate. A clear position, set out in writing, can assist a Prescribed NPO in deciding whether a proposed NPO programme of work creates too much risk exposure to be undertaken.</p> <p>37. It is our expectation that a risk appetite statement should confirm, at a minimum, that the Prescribed NPO will not tolerate Diversion, nor parties that enable Diversion. It may also consider and discuss:</p> <ul> <li>whether there are certain jurisdictions, territories or areas in which the NPO is comfortable to operate, such as where it has previous experience and is engaged with known associate NPOs. There may be other places where the NPO is unwilling to operate;</li> <li>if the Prescribed NPO will avoid certain routes or geographical areas, or particular relationships, or the use of certain payment methods (e.g., cash, pre-paid cards, Hawala, mobile money, virtual assets etc.);</li> <li>if working alongside certain associate NPOs falls outside the NPO 's risk appetite;</li> <li>what contractual arrangements and terms it will be prepared to put in place working with an associate NPO, for example seeking undertakings of non-tolerance for Diversion;</li> <li>what types of donors it will accept funding from;</li> <li>who it will distribute benefits to and where;</li> <li>certain conflict levels which it will not tolerate, such as delivering aid in an active warzone.</li> </ul> <p>38. When preparing the NPO PRA and risk appetite statement, it is important to recognise that an NPO 's risk management capabilities are not always transferrable from one NPO programme to another. If adequate safeguards cannot be put in place regarding a particular NPO programme, it should be considered whether another NPO, with greater capability, ought to carry out the NPO programme instead.</p> <p>39. A Prescribed NPO may consider that it is able to establish a risk-based approach through methods other than conducting a NPO PRA, and/or risk appetite statement. In these circumstances, the Prescribed NPO is expected to demonstrate how its alternative measures achieve the same outcome as those set out above.</p> <p>40. Where a Prescribed NPO is receiving services from a CD regulated TCSP, it may be appropriate for the CD regulated TCSP to add the output of the NPO PRA and risk appetite statement to their own BRA (see section 2.3.1 of the Handbook ).</p> <p>41. A CD regulated TCSP may also consider it appropriate to integrate any periodic testing of the Prescribed NPO 's systems and controls into the testing undertaken for their TCSP business (see section 2.4.2 of the Handbook ).</p>","tags":["section-17"]},{"location":"sections/17-prescribed-npos/#17311-prescribed-npos-solely-remitting-to-charities-in-equivalent-jurisdictions","title":"17.3.1.1 Prescribed NPOs solely remitting to charities in equivalent jurisdictions","text":"<p>42. For guidance in terms of what is meant by an equivalent jurisdiction, see Appendix B of the Handbook.</p> <p>43. A number of NPOs established in Jersey conduct no activity apart from disbursing funds to charities which are operating in equivalent jurisdictions. Examples of this type of operating model include:</p> <ul> <li>a faith-based NPO sending funds to a larger faith-based organisation, based in an equivalent jurisdiction, which conducts mission activities across the world;</li> <li>a Jersey branch of a global aid organisation sending funds to its headquarters based in an equivalent jurisdiction.</li> </ul> <p>44.

Therefore, they ask the charity to provide details of their systems and controls to counter terrorist financing. This may include speaking with the charity's Head of CFT, reviewing their policy manual and finding out who their associate NPOs are. The Prescribed NPO may also consider the track record of the charity and their associate NPOs through a search for adverse news articles on Google or similar search engines.

A Prescribed NPO may demonstrate they are adequately monitoring risk by keeping records of their monitoring activities in a Diversion risk register. An example of a Diversion risk register can be downloaded from our website: draft Diversion risk register template.</p> <p>49. This template is not intended to be rigid or prescriptive. A Prescribed NPO may decide, with reference to its NPO PRA and/or risk appetite statement (or equivalents) that it should carry out monitoring on more, less or different risks than those listed in the template Diversion risk register.</p> <p>50. When completing the Diversion risk register, a Prescribed NPO should refer to their NPO PRA and/or risk appetite statement (or equivalents) to help them conclude the risk level of a particular area, and what controls should be put in place. For example:</p> <ul> <li>a risk area assessed as low risk may only need minimal controls;</li> <li>a risk area assessed as medium risk may need some additional controls; and</li> <li>a higher risk activity may need significant additional controls. If it is judged that the risk cannot be mitigated by the Prescribed NPO to an acceptable level, it would be appropriate to leave this work to another party that can effectively manage the risk.</li> </ul> <p>51. It is recommended that a periodic review of a NPO 's risks is conducted at least annually. Through the application of a risk-based approach, it can be determined whether certain risks should be monitored more or less frequently. For example:</p> <ul> <li>A Prescribed NPO whose sole activity is disbursing funds to a reputable charity which only carries out activity in an equivalent jurisdiction may only need to review their exposure to higher-risk jurisdictions on an annual basis; for example, by seeking confirmation from the overseas charity that it continues to only act within their home jurisdiction;</li> <li>If a Prescribed NPO is supporting displaced persons in a country undergoing civil conflict its activity is potentially exposed to the risk of being extorted for a portion of the NPO Funds to gain access to the NPO Beneficiaries. In this case it would be more appropriate to monitor the risk of association with a target of financial sanctions related to terrorism on a more regular basis at an interval that is appropriate in the circumstances, e.g., quarterly.</li> </ul> <p>52. In all cases, the outcome of periodic reviews should be documented. A Prescribed NPO should be able to explain and justify why it has chosen to conduct its risk monitoring in a certain manner, and at a certain interval.</p>","tags":["section-17"]},{"location":"sections/17-prescribed-npos/#174-npo-beneficiaries-associate-npos-and-donors","title":"17.4 NPO Beneficiaries, associate NPOs and donors","text":"","tags":["section-17"]},{"location":"sections/17-prescribed-npos/#1741-npo-beneficiaries","title":"17.4.1 NPO Beneficiaries","text":"<p>Statutory Requirement</p> <p>53.

NPO Beneficiaries are defined in the Glossary of this Handbook. As noted, this term captures natural persons, as well as groups of natural persons.</p> <p>55. For the purposes of the Handbook, a Prescribed NPO establishes a relationship with an NPO Beneficiary.</p> <p>56. To comply with the Prescribed NPO Order, a Prescribed NPO will need to apply a level of due diligence on its NPO Beneficiaries. The due diligence in this respect is not intended to follow that of financial services busines ses, since this would not be proportionate, nor appropriate. Instead, the NPO should identify its NPO Beneficiaries by applying a risk-based approach.</p> <p>57. In the context of NPO Beneficiaries, a risk-based approach means applying sufficient measures, having regard to the NPO PRA and risk appetite statement (or equivalent documents), to be satisfied that the NPO Beneficiary is not involved in terrorism or terrorist financing. A higher level of risk may require more stringent measures to be applied, whilst a lower level of risk might require less.</p> <p>58. Throughout section 17 of the Handbook, it may be relevant for a Prescribed NPO to refer to other sections of this Handbook for additional guidance. When reviewing these sections, a Prescribed NPO should consider the term ' customer ' to refer to NPO Beneficiaries.</p> <p>59. Where a Prescribed NPO is receiving services from a CD regulated TCSP and it is considered appropriate to do so, the NPO may choose to apply due diligence measures which are aligned with those set out in sections 3 and 4 of this Handbook.</p> <p>Guidance</p> <p>60. Where a NPO Beneficiary is a single person, a Prescribed NPO may demonstrate that it has taken reasonable measures to identify that person where it obtains the following information:</p> <ul> <li>Name;</li> <li>Date of birth (if possible);</li> <li>Country of birth;</li> <li>Current area of residence.</li> </ul> <p>61. The amount of identity information requested may differ based on the outcome of the NPO PRA (or equivalent).</p> <p>62. Identity information for an individual may be obtained directly from the NPO Beneficiary, or their representative.</p> <p>63. Where a NPO Beneficiary is a group of persons, for example refugees from a particular conflict, there is no requirement to identify each individual person.</p> <p>64. In these cases, the Prescribed NPO may demonstrate that is has taken reasonable measures to identify the group if the characteristics of that group are consistent with the purpose and objectives set out in the Prescribed NPO 's constitutional documents (or their equivalent).</p> <p>65. For example, if the Prescribed NPO 's constitutional documents state that its objective is to provide humanitarian support to victims of conflict, this would be consistent with a group of NPO Beneficiaries who are a group of refugees from such conflicts.</p> <p>66. However, the Prescribed NPO should be alive to the fact that different classes of NPO Beneficiaries will present different levels of risk from a terrorist financing perspective based on their location and proximity to terrorist organisations etc.</p> <p>67. Identity information for a group of persons may be obtained from a representative of that group.</p> <p>Guidance</p> <p>68. As part of its reasonable measures in respect of NPO Beneficiaries, a Prescribed NPO will need to obtain information on the nature and purpose of their relationship with the NPO Beneficiary. It should do this by requesting and documenting the information at the establishment of the relationship.</p> <p>69. The 'nature' of a relationship may include:</p> <ul> <li>the amount and type of NPO Funds which would be applied to the NPO Beneficiary/(-ies);</li> <li>whether any associate NPOs are involved, and their purpose.</li> </ul> <p>70. The 'purpose' of a relationship may include:</p> <ul> <li>what the activity is aiming to achieve, such as building a pump to provide a rural community with access to clean water or distributing food to victims of a drought.</li> </ul> <p>Guidance</p> <p>71. Where a NPO Beneficiary is a single person, a Prescribed NPO may demonstrate that it has taken reasonable measures to confirm that person is not assisting, or being used to assist, terrorism/the financing of terrorism, where it takes steps to ascertain whether the person is a legitimate NPO Beneficiary. Such steps may include:</p> <ul> <li>seeking a reference from an independent person to corroborate the information provided by or regarding the NPO Beneficiary. For example, if the NPO Beneficiary is a child staying in an orphanage, the reference should confirm that the child is in fact staying there;</li> <li>visiting the location where the NPO Funds will be applied to consider whether the amount(s) to be applied appear reasonable given what is proposed to be done with them;</li> <li>considering if the amount(s) to be applied to the NPO Beneficiary makes sense when compared to previous relationships with similar characteristics;</li> <li>reviewing the correspondence held with the NPO Beneficiary, their representatives and relevant associate NPOs, then considering if the proposed relationship makes sense based on what they have said.</li> </ul> <p>72. Where a NPO Beneficiary is a group of persons, for example refugees from a war zone, there is no requirement to obtain a confirmation for each individual person. The Prescribed NPO should still take account of the characteristics of the group of NPO Beneficiaries when preparing its NPO PRA (or equivalent).</p> <p>73. In these cases, the Prescribed NPO may demonstrate compliance with the Prescribed NPO Order by taking measures to ensure the group of persons are legitimate NPO Beneficiaries. This may be achieved by, for example:</p> <ul> <li>visiting the location where the NPO Funds will be applied and by considering whether the amount(s) to be applied appear to be reasonable given what is proposed to be done with them;</li> <li>considering if the amount(s) to be applied to the group of NPO Beneficiaries makes sense when compared to previous relationships with similar characteristics;</li> <li>reviewing the correspondence held with the group of NPO Beneficiaries, their representatives and relevant associate NPOs, then considering if the proposed business relationship or one-off transaction makes sense based on what they have said.</li> </ul> <p>74. Based on the assessed risk of the relationship with the NPO Beneficiaries, one or more of the above measures may be appropriate.</p>","tags":["section-17"]},{"location":"sections/17-prescribed-npos/#1742-associate-npos","title":"17.4.2 Associate NPOs","text":"<p>Statutory Requirement</p> <p>75.

Where an associate NPO is a natural person, a Prescribed NPO may demonstrate that it has taken reasonable measures to identify that associate NPO where it obtains the following information:</p> <ul> <li>Name;</li> <li>Date of birth (if possible);</li> <li>Country of birth;</li> <li>Current area of residence;</li> <li>Principal area of operations.</li> </ul> <p>84. Where an associate NPO is a legal person (such as a company) or a legal arrangement (such as a trust), a Prescribed NPO should obtain the following information:</p> <ul> <li>date of incorporation or establishment;</li> <li>country of incorporation or establishment;</li> <li>principal area of operations;</li> <li>names of the associate NPO Controllers, e.g., board members or trustees.</li> </ul> <p>85. Identity information may be obtained directly from the associate NPO, or their representative.</p> <p>86. The amount of identity information obtained may differ through the taking of a risk-based approach, based on the outcome of the NPO PRA and the NPO 's risk appetite statement. For example, where the NPO PRA produces a higher risk outcome the Prescribed NPO may wish to also obtain the names of the associate NPO 's owners, e.g., shareholders or partners of a partnership arrangement.</p> <p>Guidance</p> <p>87. A Prescribed NPO may demonstrate that it has obtained information on the nature and purpose of a relationship where it requests and documents this information at the establishment of a relationship.</p> <p>88. The 'nature' of a relationship may include:</p> <ul> <li>the type of activity the associate NPO will undertake on behalf of the Prescribed NPO, e.g., delivering medical supplies to a disaster area;</li> <li>how that activity is intended to be carried out, e.g., the associate NPO will utilise its fleet of heavy-duty vehicles.</li> </ul> <p>89. The 'purpose' of a relationship may include:</p> <ul> <li>the reason the Prescribed NPO is engaging with the associate NPO, e.g., the associate NPO is able to access areas of a country which, for security reasons, the Prescribed NPO is otherwise unable to reach.</li> </ul> <p>Guidance</p> <p>90. A Prescribed NPO may demonstrate that it has taken reasonable measures to confirm an associate NPO is not assisting, or being used to assist, terrorism/the financing of terrorism where it does so use robust, independent data sources.</p> <p>91. Based on the outcome of the NPO PRA, a greater or lesser level of measures may be necessary to mitigate the risk of the associate NPO being involved in terrorist financing. However, Prescribed NPOs should always include the following checks in their due diligence measures relating to associate NPOs:</p> <ul> <li>screening against the UK and Jersey lists of Proscribed terrorist organisations;</li> <li>screening against the UNSC Consolidated List; and</li> <li>the OFSI Consolidated sanctions list and the UK sanctions list.</li> </ul> <p>92. A Prescribed NPO may undertake screening in respect of sanctions through several different methods. These should be tailored so they are appropriate to its size and complexity. Examples may include:</p> <ul> <li>a Prescribed NPO which is receiving services from a CD regulated TCSP might utilise a screening program developed by a professional due diligence firm to which the service provider already has access;</li> <li>if checks which substantively achieve what is set out in paragraphs 90 and 91 above have recently been carried out by the Prescribed NPO 's service provider in compliance with its requirements under sections 3 of the Handbook, it is not necessary for the service provider to repeat them;</li> <li>where a Prescribed NPO is small and individuals participate on a part-time/voluntary basis, the checks may be carried out by a person directly accessing the above-referenced lists and searching for the required names via the 'Find' function of their internet browser.</li> </ul> <p>93. The Prescribed NPO needs to be cognisant that when undertaking screening, it is important to remember that the connection to sanctioned/designated persons and proscribed terrorist organisations is more likely to be hidden, meaning that the person the NPO is engaging with is not necessarily directly captured in the lists the Prescribed NPO is checking against. Instead, they may be indirectly captured via their associations with terrorists, which may not be immediately apparent, but which can be brought to light through undertaking additional enquiries.</p> <p>94. The independent data sources used should seek to confirm that the associate NPO is a legitimate person or operation. Set out below are some examples of due diligence which may be carried out at different levels of risk. The Prescribed NPO should document its decision in each case regarding how much due diligence it has decided to undertake:</p> <ul> <li>Lower risk:</li> <li>obtaining details of the legal person or arrangement from an online registry;</li> <li>seeking references from other NPOs to corroborate the information the associate NPO has provided;</li> <li>undertaking an open-source check (e.g., Google) to ascertain if the associate NPO has been subject to any adverse media coverage.</li> <li>Medium risk</li> <li> <p>review of registration documentation;</p> </li> <li> <p>understanding how long an associate NPO has been operating, e.g. has it been set up 'overnight' to capitalise on a market opportunity?</p> </li> <li>Higher risk</li> <li>inspecting the associate NPO's site of operations to view their activities first-hand (or commissioning a trusted third party to do so);</li> <li>inspections of associate NPO records and financial statements;</li> <li>requesting details of their antiDiversion systems and controls and testing them.</li> </ul> <p>95. There may be circumstances where a Prescribed NPO has a long-term relationship with an associate NPO. In this scenario, they may consider that additional verification of the associate NPO 's identity, as set out above, is not required. If the NPO takes this decision, they should ensure their rationale for undertaking no further verification is documented. An example is set out below:</p> <ul> <li>a Prescribed NPO in Jersey provides monetary aid to several rural communities in a foreign country. The NPO Funds are sent to their associate NPO, where a local faith leader is responsible for ensuring NPO Funds are distributed where they are most needed, to legitimate NPO Beneficiaries. The Prescribed NPO has worked with the associate NPO for over a decade and several members of the Governing body have met with the local faith leader personally. Through this relationship, they are satisfied that the faith leader is a respectable person of good standing. The Prescribed NPO considers that no further verification is required. The Governing body records their rationale at the next general meeting.</li> </ul> <p>96. To help mitigate terrorist financing risk, a Prescribed NPO may wish to consider putting a partnership agreement in place to govern the relationship with the associate NPO. This agreement might include certain clauses to ensure a strong CFT framework is put together and maintained. Example clauses include:</p> <ul> <li>an explanation of what terrorist financing and Diversion is;</li> <li>an undertaking that the associate NPO has appropriate measures in place to mitigate the risks of terrorist financing, and commits the associate NPO, on a best endeavours basis, to preventing it from occurring;</li> <li>permitting the Prescribed NPO to request whatever information is necessary from the associate NPO to satisfy its due diligence requirements;</li> <li>agreeing to the Prescribed NPO carrying out spot-checks on the activities of the associate NPO or its representative. Where a physical visit is not possible due to, for example, safety concerns, other measures of verification may be permitted such as video calls, requesting copies of invoices etc.;</li> <li>requiring the associate NPO to maintain an audit trail of its activities and provide it to the Prescribed NPO upon request (may also extend to formal financial records);</li> <li>the Prescribed NPO reserving the right to terminate the business relationship or one-off transaction should the outcome of any checks be unsatisfactory, or if it is identified that Diversion has taken place.</li> </ul> <p>97. There may be circumstances where a Prescribed NPO concludes that it is not possible, nor necessary, to put a partnership agreement, or one with CFT clauses, in place. If this is the case, the NPO should be able to explain why they took that decision and how they consider the risk of Diversion to be mitigated without a partnership agreement, or CFT clauses, being in place.</p>","tags":["section-17"]},{"location":"sections/17-prescribed-npos/#17421-exceptional-circumstances","title":"17.4.2.1 Exceptional circumstances","text":"<p>Guidance</p> <p>98.

Of course, this does not mean that Prescribed NPOs should undertake a lesser level of due diligence compared to where the need is less urgent. A Prescribed NPO which intends to operate in emergency scenarios will need to demonstrate they are prepared and able to implement effective controls when engaging associate NPOs for this purpose.</p> <p>100. A Prescribed NPO may therefore demonstrate compliance with Article 6 of the Prescribed NPO Order where it:</p> <ul> <li>establishes and maintains effective procedures governing how it will identify and engage appropriate associate NPOs in any given scenario;</li> <li>undertakes as much due diligence at the outset as can be done without unduly delaying the establishment of the relationship; and</li> <li>undertakes the remaining checks deemed appropriate by the NPO PRA as soon as possible following the commencement of the relationship, e.g., whilst the associate NPO is operating 'on the ground' in the local area where distributions are carried out.</li> </ul> <p>101. Where the above approach has been taken, a Prescribed NPO should clearly document its rationale for applying this exception and set out a timeframe during which the remaining checks will be carried out and such allowances should also be documented in its NPO risk appetite statement.</p> <p>102. The Prescribed NPO should consider including a clause in its partnership agreement whereby it reserves the right to terminate the relationship should the outcome of the checks be unsatisfactory.</p> <p>103. Equally, a Prescribed NPO may consider utilising a 'preferred partner' /associate NPO which has already been through the due diligence process before the exceptional event occurs.</p>","tags":["section-17"]},{"location":"sections/17-prescribed-npos/#1743-npo-donors","title":"17.4.3 NPO donors","text":"<p>Statutory Requirement</p> <p>104. Article 5 of the Prescribed NPO Order requires a Prescribed NPO to keep records of donors who, during the preceding 12 months, have donated (as a single donation or cumulatively) -</p> <ul> <li>\u00a310,000 or above; or</li> <li>over 50% of total donations made to the Prescribed NPO during that period.</li> </ul> <p>105. Donations to Prescribed NPOs are diverse. For example, a significant contribution made by a wealthy individual or institution, or a small monthly contribution made by a member of the public.</p> <p>106. For the purposes of the Handbook, the relationship between a Prescribed NPO and its donors is not considered to constitute a business relationship or one-off transaction.</p> <p>107. As noted above, Article 5 of the Prescribed NPO Order requires Prescribed NPOs to keep a record of 'significant donors', i.e., those falling within Article 5(1)(a) and 5(1)(b) of the Prescribed NPO Order.</p> <p>108. To comply with the Prescribed NPO Order, a Prescribed NPO will need to apply a level of due diligence to its significant donors.</p> <p>109. Prescribed NPOs should refer to their NPO PRA and their risk appetite statement (or equivalent documents) and use their judgement to determine how much identity information needs to be obtained in each case to mitigate the risk of Diversion.</p> <p>110. There is no requirement in the Prescribed NPO Order to verify the identity information collected for significant donors. However, in some circumstances, such as when the NPO PRA (or equivalent) produces a higher-risk outcome, the Prescribed NPO may consider it necessary to do so. In these cases, the NPO should utilise robust, independent data sources to confirm the significant donor is a legitimate person or operation -see the guidance in section 17.4.2 of this Handbook.</p> <p>111. Where a Prescribed NPO is receiving services from a CD regulated TCSP and it is considered appropriate to do so, the NPO may choose to apply due diligence measures which are aligned with those set out in sections 3 and 4 of this Handbook.</p> <p>112. For the avoidance of doubt, there is no statutory or Code of Practice requirement to make the identities of any significant donors public, for example via a Prescribed NPO 's annual financial statement.</p> <p>Guidance</p> <p>113. Where a significant donor is a natural person, a Prescribed NPO may demonstrate that it has taken reasonable measures to identify that person where it obtains the following information:</p> <ul> <li>Name;</li> <li>Date of birth;</li> <li>Country of birth;</li> <li>Current residential address.</li> </ul> <p>114. Where a significant donor is a legal person (such as a company) or a legal arrangement (such as a trust), a Prescribed NPO should obtain the following information:</p> <ul> <li>date of incorporation or establishment;</li> <li>country of incorporation or establishment;</li> <li>registered address;</li> <li>names of the significant donor's controllers, e.g., board members or trustees;</li> <li>names of the significant donor's owners, e.g., shareholders or partners of a partnership arrangement.</li> </ul> <p>115. Information collected on significant donors may be kept in a register, list, or similar format.</p> <p>116. As noted above, it may be considered necessary to obtain additional identity information based on the outcome of the NPO PRA and the NPO 's risk appetite statement (or equivalent documents). For example, a higher-risk rating might mean the Prescribed NPO requests further information from their significant donors.</p> <p>117. Based on the outcome of the NPO PRA and the NPO 's risk appetite statement (or equivalent documents), and where a significant donor is not a natural person, it may be considered necessary to understand the ownership structure of that significant donor and the persons who control it. For example, a Prescribed NPO may consider it necessary where a higher-risk rating is produced. In these situations, Prescribed NPOs should follow the guidance set out in the relevant sections of the Handbook listed below, in respect of identifying beneficial owners and controllers:</p> <ul> <li>Trusts -section 4.4.1 of this Handbook;</li> <li>Limited Partnerships -section 4.4.3 of this Handbook;</li> <li>Companies -section 4.5.1 of this Handbook;</li> <li>Foundations -section 4.5.3 of this Handbook;</li> <li>Partnerships -section 4.5.5 of this Handbook.</li> </ul> <p>118. Where a significant donor makes regular payments to a Prescribed NPO, it is not necessary to obtain identity information every time a donation is received from that donor. In these cases, Prescribed NPOs should seek to reconfirm the donor's identity information at least every two years. The re-confirmation should be undertaken sooner where it is known that there has been a change in the significant donor's information, e.g., a natural person has changed residential address, or the board of a corporate significant donor has changed.</p>","tags":["section-17"]},{"location":"sections/17-prescribed-npos/#175-identification-screening-and-training-of-relevant-volunteers-relevant-employees-owners-and-controllers","title":"17.5 Identification, screening and training of relevant volunteers, relevant employees, Owners and Controllers","text":"<p>119.

The test is whether that person can exercise control over, or direct, the activities of the Prescribed NPO.</p> <p>129. It is possible for an individual to be considered a NPO Owner or NPO Controller where they hold their ownership interest or exercise control through indirect means. For example:</p> <ul> <li>where a Prescribed NPO is established as a company, an individual who holds shares in the NPO through an intermediate holding vehicle will be considered a NPO Owner;</li> <li>an individual who does not sit on the Governing body of the NPO, but in accordance with whose directions the Governing body are nevertheless accustomed to act will be a NPO Controller.</li> </ul> <p>AML/CFT/CPF Code of Practice</p> <p>130.

As noted in section 17.5.1 of this Handbook, this section is provided as guidance on best practice. There are no mandatory Code of Practice requirements set out in this section.</p> <p>135. For the purposes of this section, the term ' relevant employees ' means an individual who is working under a contract of employment and undertakes one or more of the following as part of their role:</p> <ul> <li>Acts as a NPO Controller; and/or</li> <li>Is responsible for the disbursement, and/or raising, of NPO Funds outside of Jersey, Guernsey, the Isle of Man, England and Wales, or Scotland.</li> </ul> <p>136.

In addition to completing the checks listed at paragraph 141 above, a Prescribed NPO may demonstrate that its relevant volunteers and relevant employees are screened where it does one or more of the following, as appropriate for the nature of the relevant volunteer or relevant employee's role and responsibilities, and on a risk-based approach:</p> <ul> <li>obtains and confirms references provided;</li> <li>obtains and confirms employment history and qualifications disclosed;</li> <li>obtains details of any regulatory action taken against the individual (or absence of such action);</li> <li>obtains and confirms details of any criminal convictions (or absence of such convictions).</li> </ul> <p>144.

Circumstances where the AMLSP is likely to fulfil the AML/CFT/CPF obligations for both the legal person and where the legal person is acting in relation to a legal arrangement may be where the AMLSP Direct Customer is acting as the Governing body for one legal arrangement. For example, where the AMLSP Direct Customer is a SPV trustee, or SPV general partner, without employees other than directors.</p> <p>71. Some examples of circumstances where a n AMLSP arrangement in respect of a legal person acting for itself and a legal arrangement may not be appropriate include:</p> <ul> <li>Where the trustee or the general partner are businesses with presence in the island which have their own employees;</li> <li>Where the trustees or the general partner provide services to multiple legal arrangements/funds; or</li> <li>Where the complexity, frequency or risks posed by the fund require a more subjective bespoke approach.</li> </ul> <p>72. Section 13 of this Handbook provides additional information regarding funds and fund operators, with section 13.2.4 of this Handbook regarding risk-assessments for SPV governing bodies providing guidance regarding potential approaches to the consolidation of risk assessments for legal arrangements.</p>","tags":["section-18"]}]}
