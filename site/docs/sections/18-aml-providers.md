# Section 18 - AML Service Providers

**1.** This section applies only to supervised persons who are eligible to appoint an AMLSP in accordance with the Notice issued under Article 9A(4) of the Money Laundering Order ( Article 9A(4) Notice ).

**2.** An individual or organisation which is a supervised person may itself fulfil its own AML/CFT/CPF obligations. Alternatively, it may engage the services of an AMLSP and/or outsource within its group or to a third party (an outsourcing services provider) to assist it in meeting certain AML/CFT/CPF obligations.

**3.** The use of an AMLSP will not be subject JFSC 's Outsourcing Policy. The use of any other party, whether within the same group of the supervised person or not, is outsourcing and will be subject to the JFSC 's Outsourcing Policy. Section 18 of this Handbook will not apply to such outsourcing arrangements.

**4.** The provision of MLRO/MLCO roles to a supervised person may be undertaken by an AMLSP. It cannot however be outsourced within the AMLSPs wider group or to a third party.

**5.** Where a supervised person engages the services of an AMLSP, they shall be an AMLSP Direct Customer.

**6.** This section outlines the statutory provisions concerning the AMLSP. It also sets out the AML/CFT/CPF Codes of Practice and provides guidance on the obligations of an AMLSP and how an AMLSP might assist an AMLSP Direct Customer in fulfilling its AML/CFT/CPF obligations.

**7.** It is expected that the AMLSP Direct Customer will use the AMLSP to enable it to meet most of its AML/CFT/CPF obligations.

**8.** The AMLSP Direct Customer bears the ultimate responsibility for the activities undertaken in its name. This will include the requirement to determine that the AMLSP has in place satisfactory systems and controls (including policies and procedures ), and that those systems and controls (including policies and procedures ) are kept up-to-date to reflect changes in requirements.

### 18.2 AMSLPs

#### 18.2.1 AMLSP systems and controls

!!! warning "AML/CFT/CPF Code of Practice"

    **9.** An AMLSP must include consideration of its AMLSP services within:

    - its BRA;
    - its formal strategy to counter money laundering, the financing of terrorism, or the financing of proliferation ( AML/CFT/CPF strategy); and
    - its systems and controls (including policies and procedures ).

    **10.** An AMLSP must consider AMLSP Indirect Customers as if they were its own customers when providing AMLSP services.

    **11.** Considering the conclusions of the BRA and AML/CFT/CPF strategy as they relate to the AMLSP services, the AMLSP must:

    - organise and control its affairs in a way that effectively mitigates the risks that it has identified, including areas that are complex; and
    - be able to demonstrate the existence of adequate and effective systems and controls (including policies and procedures ) to counter money laundering, the financing of terrorism, or the financing of proliferation.

    **12.** An AMLSP must assess possible money laundering, terrorist financing, or proliferation financing risk associated with sub-outsourced functions, record its assessment, and monitor any risk on an ongoing basis.


!!! info "Guidance"

    **13.** An AMLSP may demonstrate consideration of its AMLSP services within its BRA, AML/CFT/CPF strategy, and systems and controls (including policies and procedures ) by clearly documenting the AMLSP services that it provides for its AMLSP Direct Customers and determining whether there are any differences arising from the provision of AMLSP services for its AMLSP Direct Customers by comparison to the AML/CFT/CPF activities that the AMLSP performs for its other customers.

    **14.** For example, if there is clear documentation showing that the AMLSP services provided for AMLSP Direct Customers feature the same activities in respect of AMLSP Indirect Customers that the AMLSP performs for its other customers then this may be taken to indicate that the AMLSP has considered its AMLSP services within its BRA, AML/CFT/CPF strategy and systems and controls (including policies and procedures ).

    **15.** Where the activities of an AMLSP Direct Customer are similar in nature to an AMLSP 's other customers extending the AMLSP 's BRA, AML/CFT/CPF strategy and systems and controls (including policies and procedures ) to include activities performed for AMLSP Direct Customers in respect of AMLSP Indirect Customers may be a natural extension.

    **16.** Careful consideration of the following differences, and clear documentation of the measures taken to address these differences, may be taken to demonstrate that the AMLSP has properly considered AMLSP Direct Customers, and AMLSP Indirect Customers, in its BRA, AML/CFT/CPF strategy and systems and controls (including policies and procedures ).

    - Where the activities or operations of AMLSP Direct Customers are not similar in nature to an AMLSP 's own activities or operations; or
    - Where AMLSP Indirect Customers are not similar in nature to the other customers of an AMLSP.

    **17.** An AMLSP may demonstrate consideration of AMLSP Indirect Customers as if they were its own customers by demonstrating the application of its BRA, AML/CFT/CPF strategy, and systems and controls (including policies and procedures ) as amended for any differences in the nature of its AMLSP Direct Customers, and AMLSP Indirect Customers to its other customers.


#### 18.2.2 AMLSP responsibilities

!!! danger "Statutory Requirement"

    **18.** Article 9A(1) of the Money Laundering Order provides that a relevant person may appoint an AMLSP to appoint a MLCO and a MLRO and to comply with any other requirement of the relevant person under the Money Laundering Order.


!!! warning "AML/CFT/CPF Code of Practice"

    **19.** The AMLSP must appoint an employee or employees to carry out the roles of AMLSP Direct Customer MLCO and AMLSP Direct Customer MLRO to each AMLSP Direct Customer. There can be no outsourcing of these roles by the AMLSP.

    **20.** The AMLSP must make the appointment from a list of persons to whom the JFSC has provided its 'no objection' in accordance with the Article 9A(4) Notice to such individuals being appointed as AMLSP Direct Customer MLCOs and AMLSP Direct Customer MLROs, and also notifying the JFSC of the removal of anyone from the list.

    **21.** The AMLSP need not supply the JFSC with updates on individual appointments into the roles for particular AMLSP Direct Customers but, must supply up to date information to the JFSC on request.

    **22.** The AMLSP must be able to demonstrate that it is providing services such that it has sufficient oversight and access to relevant information to appropriately manage the risks of providing the AMLSP services and to enable the AMLSP Direct Customer MLCO and the AMLSP Direct Customer MLRO, provided by the AMLSP, to fulfil their roles for the AMLSP Direct Customer.

    **23.** An AMLSP must provide sufficient information to satisfy an AMLSP Direct Customer that the AMLSP is fulfilling the AML/CFT/CPF obligations on an ongoing basis in accordance with the written agreement for services with the AMLSP Direct Customer.

    **24.** An AMLSP must demonstrate to its AMLSP Direct Customer how knowledge, suspicion, or reasonable grounds for knowledge or suspicion of money laundering, terrorist financing, or proliferation financing activity will be reported to the AMLSP Direct Customer MLRO (or their Deputy ).

    **25.** An AMLSP must notify the JFSC and its AMLSP Direct Customer, immediately in writing of any material failures to comply with the requirements of the Money Laundering Order or the AML/CFT/CPF Handbook in respect of the AMLSP services it provides.

    **26.** An AMLSP must consider the effect that sub-outsourcing of activities that it performs as an AMLSP has on money laundering, terrorist financing, and proliferation financing risk, in particular where an AMLSP Direct Customer MLCO or AMLSP Direct Customer MLRO is provided with additional support from other parties, whether from within group or externally.


!!! info "Guidance"

    **27.** The guidance in sections 2.3 and 2.4 of this Handbook will support AMLSPs in their approach to their general responsibilities.

    **28.** Where it is deemed appropriate, considering the size and complexity of the AMLSP Direct Customer, the JFSC anticipates the same Employee could hold both AMLSP Direct Customer MLCO and MLRO roles.

    **29.** Evidence to support compliance with the AML/CFT/CPF Codes of Practice at section 18.2.2 of this Handbook is likely to include:

    - Documented consideration of AMLSP services, AMLSP Direct Customers, and AMLSP Indirect Customers within an AMLSP 's BRA, AML/CFT/CPF strategy and systems and controls (including policies and procedures );
    - A written agreement for services between an AMLSP and its AMLSP Direct Customer regarding the provision of AMLSP services; and
    - Consideration of AMLSP services in the AMLSP 's board minutes (or equivalent if the AMLSP is not a company).


#### 18.2.3 AMLSP Direct Customer MLCO

!!! danger "Statutory Requirement"

    **30.** Article 9A(2) of the Money Laundering Order provides that an AMLSP must fulfil the obligations of an AMLSP Direct Customer by appointing an Employee as MLCO.


!!! warning "AML/CFT/CPF Code of Practice"

    **31.** An AMLSP must appoint an individual as AMLSP Direct Customer MLCO for an AMLSP Direct Customer that:

    - is employed by the AMLSP or an enterprise in the same financial group as the AMLSP;
    - is based in Jersey;
    - has sufficient experience and skills.

    **32.** An AMLSP must ensure that the AMLSP Direct Customer 's MLCO:

    - has appropriate independence, in particular from customer -facing, business development and systems and controls development roles;
    - reports regularly and directly to the MLCO of the AMLSP (where they are not the same person) and has a sufficient level of authority within the AMLSP so that the MLCO of the AMLSP reacts to and acts upon reports made by the AMLSP Direct Customer MLCO;
    - is able to raise issues directly with the Governing body of the AMLSP Direct Customer;
    - has sufficient resources, including sufficient time and (if appropriate) a Deputy AMLSP Direct Customer MLCO and compliance support staff;
    - is fully aware of their, the AMLSP 's, and the AMLSP Direct Customer 's AML/CFT/CPF obligations;
    - formally acknowledges their appointment as AMLSP Direct Customer MLCO for each AMLSP Direct Customer to which they are appointed; and
    - has sufficient access to information, oversight, and knowledge of the AMLSP Direct Customer 's and the AMLSP Indirect Customer 's activities on a continuing basis to fulfil the MLCO role.

    **33.** The AMLSP Direct Customer MLCO, the AMLSP and the Governing body of the AMLSP Direct Customer must ensure any proposed AMLSP Direct Customer MLCO has sufficient skills and experience to fulfil the role of AMLSP Direct Customer MLCO of the specific AMLSP Direct Customer to which they will be appointed.

    **34.** If the position of an AMLSP Direct Customer 's MLCO is expected to fall vacant, to comply with the statutory requirement to have an individual appointed to the office of MLCO at all times, an AMLSP must take action to appoint another appropriate member of senior management to the position on a temporary basis.


!!! info "Guidance"

    **35.** Section 2.5 of this Handbook provides further information about the role of the MLCO.

    **36.** An AMLSP 's MLCO may also be appointed as an AMLSP Direct Customer MLCO.

    **37.** The appointment of an AMLSP 's MLCO as AMLSP Direct Customer MLCO is likely to be appropriate where the activities or operations of AMLSP Direct Customer s are similar in nature to an AMLSP 's other customers, and where AMLSP Indirect Customer s are similar in nature to the other customers of an AMLSP. In such circumstances, there is likely to be little difference between the AMLSP 's BRA, AML/CFT/CPF strategy and systems and controls (including policies and procedures ) in respect of both the AMLSP 's own AML/CF T/CPF activities and the AMLSP services provided to its AMLSP Direct Customer s.


#### 18.2.4 AMLSP Direct Customer MLRO

!!! danger "Statutory Requirement"

    **38.** Article 9A(2) of the Money Laundering Order provides that an AMLSP must fulfil the obligations of an AMLSP Direct Customer by appointing an Employee as MLRO.


!!! warning "AML/CFT/CPF Code of Practice"

    **39.** An AMLSP must appoint an individual as AMLSP Direct Customer MLRO for an AMLSP Direct Customer that:

    - is employed by the AMLSP or an enterprise in the same financial group as the AMLSP;
    - is based in Jersey;
    - has sufficient experience and skills.

    **40.** An AMLSP must ensure that the AMLSP Direct Customer MLRO:

    - has appropriate independence, in particular from customer -facing and business development roles;
    - has a sufficient level of authority within the AMLSP;
    - has sufficient resources, including sufficient time, and (if appropriate) is supported by Deputy AMLSP Direct Customer MLROs;
    - is able to raise issues directly with the Governing body of the AMLSP Direct Customer;
    - is fully aware of their, the AMLSP 's and the AMLSP Direct Customer 's AML/CFT/CPF obligations;
    - formally acknowledges their appointment as AMLSP Direct Customer MLRO for each AMLSP Direct Customer to which they are appointed; and
    - has sufficient access to information, oversight and knowledge of the AMLSP Direct Customer 's activities and AMLSP Indirect Customers on a continuing basis to fulfil the MLRO role.

    **41.** Where an AMLSP has appointed one or more Deputy AMLSP Direct Customer MLROs the requirements set out above for the AMLSP Direct Customer MLRO must also be applied to any Deputy AMLSP Direct Customer MLROs.

    **42.** Where an AMLSP has appointed one or more Deputy AMLSP Direct Customer MLROs, it must ensure that the AMLSP Direct Customer MLRO:

    - keeps a record of all Deputy AMLSP Direct Customer MLROs;
    - provides support to, and routinely monitors the performance of, each Deputy AMLSP Direct Customer MLRO;

    - considers and determines that SARs are being handled in an appropriate and consistent manner.

    **43.** The AMLSP Direct Customer MLRO, the AMLSP and the Governing body of the AMLSP Direct Customer must ensure any proposed AMLSP Direct Customer MLRO has sufficient skills and experience to fulfil the role of AMLSP Direct Customer MLRO of the specific AMLSP Direct Customer to which they will be appointed.

    **44.** If the position of AMLSP Direct Customer MLRO is expected to fall vacant, to comply with the statutory requirement to have an individual appointed to the office of MLRO at all times, an AMLSP must take action to appoint another appropriate member of senior management to the position on a temporary basis.


!!! info "Guidance"

    **45.** Section 2.6 of this Handbook provides further information about the role of the MLRO.

    **46.** An AMLSP 's MLRO (or Deputies, as appropriate) may also be appointed as an AMLSP Direct Customer MLRO.

    **47.** The appointment of an AMLSP ' s MLRO (or Deputies, as appropriate) as AMLSP Direct Customer MLRO is likely to be appropriate where the activities or operations of AMLSP Direct Customers are similar in nature to an AMLSP 's other customers, and where AMLSP Indirect Customers are similar in nature to the other customers of an AMLSP. In such circumstances, there is likely to be little difference between the AMLSP 's BRA, AML/CFT/CPF strategy and systems and controls (including policies and procedures) in respect of both the AMLSP 's own AML/CFT/CPF activities and the AMLSP services provided to its AMLSP Direct Customers.


### 18.3 AMLSP Direct Customers

#### 18.3.1 AMLSP systems and controls

!!! warning "AML/CFT/CPF Code of Practice"

    **48.** Before engaging the services of an AMLSP, an AMLSP Direct Customer must be satisfied the AMLSP:

    - Organises and controls its affairs in a way that effectively mitigates the risks that it has identified, including areas that are complex;
    - Is able to demonstrate the existence of adequate and effective systems and controls (including policies and procedures ) to counter money laundering and the financing of terrorism or proliferation; and
    - Is able to perform the activities required to ensure the AMLSP Direct Customer fulfils its AML/CFT/ CPF obligations.

    **49.** On an ongoing basis, the AMLSP Direct Customer must ensure its AML/CFT/CPF obligations continue to be fulfilled by its AMLSP and must be able to demonstrate its oversight of the AMLSP.


!!! info "Guidance"

    **50.** To satisfy itself an AMLSP and the AMLSP Direct Customer MLRO and AMLSP Direct Customer MLCO can perform the activities required, an AMLSP Direct Customer might ensure there is a written agreement in place between itself and its AMLSP that clearly sets out the scope of the AMLSP services. Such an agreement might include:

    - Which AML/CFT/CPF obligations the AMLSP is responsible for fulfilling;
    - How the AMLSP services are being fulfilled (service levels);
    - Frequency and content of regular reporting b y the AMLSP Direct Customer MLRO and the AMLSP Direct Customer MLCO to the AMLSP Direct Customer board (or equivalent). Such reporting to be at a frequency in line with the risks assessed within the AMLSP 's BRA;
    - Actions to be taken on trigger events such as suspicions arising, or a change in the risk profile of an AMLSP Indirect Customer;
    - Arrangements around suspicious activity reporting;
    - The requirement for an AMLSP Direct Customer to consent to the sub-outsourcing of any of the AMLSP services undertaken by its AMLSP, if sub-outsourcing is to be permitted at all; and
    - Clear acknowledgement of the AMLSP Direct Customer 's ultimate responsibility for its own AML/CFT/CPF obligations.

    **51.** The JFSC would expect to see, upon request, board minutes (or equivalent) of the Governing body of the AMLSP Direct Customer evidencing that it had carefully considered the appointments of its AMLSP, AMLSP Direct Customer MLRO and AMLSP Direct Customer MLCO prior to such appointments taking effect.

    **52.** Demonstrating that the AMLSP is providing the services it has contracted to and they are fulfilling the AMLSP Direct Customer 's AML/CFT/ CPF obligations may be achieved through:

    - the ongoing oversight of the AMLSP Direct Customer ' s Governing body of the AMLSP services. For example, if there is scheduled compliance reporting that this is complied with; and
    - the Governing body of an AMLSP Direct Customer having participated in all relevant training provided by their AMLSP to its equivalent employees may support the AMLSP Direct Customer in demonstrating compliance with its AML/CFT/CPF obligations.

    **53.** The JFSC would expect to see, upon request, board minutes (or equivalent) of the Governing body of the AMLSP Direct Customer evidencing the ongoing monitoring of services provided by the AMLSP.


#### 18.3.2 AMLSP Direct Customer general responsibilities

!!! warning "AML/CFT/CPF Code of Practice"

    **54.** An AMLSP Direct Customer must be satisfied that knowledge, suspicion, or reasonable grounds for knowledge or suspicion of money laundering or financing of terrorism activity will be reported to the AMLSP Direct Customer MLRO (or Deputy MLRO ).


!!! info "Guidance"

    **55.** An AMLSP Direct Customer could, when engaging with an AMLSP to assist in fulfilling its AML/CFT/CPF obligations, for example, use one of the methods set out in the below table, subject to appropriate risk-based modifications.

    **56.** The JFSC recognises that it may not be appropriate in all cases for an AMLSP Direct Customer to adopt either of the two methods in totality or in part as set out below and a more bespoke approach may be required. For example, in complex high-risk scenarios.


| Method 1 | Method 2 |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| AMLSP provides a form of BRA, CRA, and policies and procedures (in a similar form to its own) which can be adopted by the AMLSP Direct Customer as its own. | The AMLSP confirms and can demonstrate to the G overning body of the AMLSP Direct Customer that the BRA, CRA, and policies and procedures of the AMLSP address the risks associated with the AMLSP Direct Customer 's business and customers (which includes AMLSP Indirect Customers and third parties for whom the AMLSP Indirect Customers act) as appropriate. For example, the AMLSP CRA of the AMLSP Direct Customer could be used as their BRA. In such instances the Governing body of the AMLSPDirect Customer would not need to adopt a separate BRA, CRA or policies and procedures. |
| AMLSP assists the AMLSP Direct Customer with the application of CDD measures at the outset of a relationship and on an ongoing basis in accordance with the policies and procedures of the AMLSP Direct Customer (which includes AMLSP Indirect Customers and third parties for whom the AMLSP Indirect Customers act). | AMLSP assists the AMLSP Direct Customer with the application of CDD measures at the outset of a relationship and on an ongoing basis in accordance with the AMLSP 's policies and procedures (which will have been extended to make it clear that the AMLSP must carry out CDD in relation to each customer of the AMLSP Direct Customer and each third party for whom that customer acts). |
| AMLSP assists the AMLSP Direct Customer with the ongoing monitoring of the AMLSP Direct Customer (which includes AMLSP Indirect Customers and third parties for whom the AMLSP Indirect Customers act). | AMLSP assists the AMLSP Direct Customer with the ongoing monitoring of the AMLSP Direct Customer (which includes AMLSP Indirect Customers and third parties for whom the AMLSP Indirect Customers act). |
| The AMLSP Direct CustomerMLCO carries out the AML compliance monitoring programme in accordance with the AML compliance monitoring programme of the AMLSP Direct Customer (in line with section 6 of this Handbook ). | The AMLSP carries out its own AML compliance monitoring programme which will include ongoing monitoring in line with section 6 of this Handbook. The AMLSP Direct Customer MLCO, they should have the authority to request adjustment of the monitoring based on risk. |

!!! info "Guidance"

    The AMLSP Direct Customer MLCO provides written periodic reporting at a frequency in line with the risks assessed of the AMLSP Direct Customer to the G overning body of the AMLSP Direct Customer.

    The AMLSP Direct Customer MLCO provides written periodic reporting at a frequency in line with the risks assessed of the AMLSP Direct Customer to the G overning body of the AMLSP Direct Customer.


#### 18.3.3 AMLSP Direct Customer -reserved activities

!!! warning "AML/CFT/CPF Code of Practice"

    **57.** The appointment of an AMLSP including the AML/CFT/CPF services to be provided by the AMLSP must be approved by the Governing body of the AMLSP Direct Customer.

    **58.** The Governing body of an AMLSP Direct Customer must approve any new business relationship (and continuation thereof) or one-off transaction where there is a connection to an enhanced risk state.

    **59.** An AMLSP Direct Customer that undergoes mergers, continuance, takeovers, or internal reorganisations, must ensure that records remain readily accessible and retrievable for the required periods in section 10 of this Handbook. This extends to the rationalising of computer systems and storage arrangements.

    **60.** Record-keeping arrangements must be agreed with the JFSC where an AMLSP Direct Customer terminates its activities or transfers customers to another person.


!!! info "Guidance"

    **61.** Reserved activities are activities that only the AMLSP Direct Customer can undertake.

    **62.** Section 10 of this Handbook provides additional information regarding record-keeping arrangements.


#### 18.3.4 AMLSP Direct Customer is a legal arrangement

!!! warning "AML/CFT/CPF Code of Practice"

    **63.** Where a Schedule 2 activity is conducted in relation to a legal arrangement, then the legal person, which is the Governing body of the legal arrangement, is responsible for the AML/CFT/CPF obligations of the legal arrangement. This applies whether the legal person is a corporate entity or a natural person.

    **64.** In some circumstances, the legal person, which is the Governing body of the legal arrangement, may have its own AML/CFT/CPF obligations in respect of the legal arrangement as well as AML/CFT/CPF obligations on behalf of the legal arrangement.

    **65.** AMLSP services provided to an AMLSP Direct Customer that is a legal person acting in relation to a legal arrangement may encompass both obligations. For example, where the legal person who is the AMLSP Direct Customer is acting in both the capacity of:

    - A fund service provider/operator/functionary to the legal arrangement (the provision of financial services within the Schedule 2 definition of fund and security services activities and a trustee or general partner which will also be a Schedule 2 activity); and

    - Governing body of the legal arrangement acting on behalf of the legal arrangement (participation in securities issues within the definition of fund and security services activities).

    **66.** This is a common arrangement in the funds sector, where for example there is a limited partnership that is a fund, and the general partner acts as both service provider to the fund as well as the Governing body of the fund.

    **67.** An AMLSP could provide the AMLSP Direct Customer MLCO and AMLSP Direct Customer MLRO to the AMLSP Direct Customer and this appointment could relate to both the AMLSP Direct Customer:

    - In its own capacity; and
    - Acting in relation to the legal arrangement.

    **68.** If the AMLSP services are to encompass a legal arrangement in relation to which the AMLSP Direct Customer is acting, the written agreement for AMLSP services is to be provided in relation to the legal arrangement.

    **69.** However, there may be circumstances where the AMLSP Direct Customer, or the AMLSP, will want to make differing arrangements in relation to those two roles because it may not be appropriate to fulfil both functions via the AMLSP. This is likely to depend on the level of complexity of the arrangement.

    **70.** Circumstances where the AMLSP is likely to fulfil the AML/CFT/CPF obligations for both the legal person and where the legal person is acting in relation to a legal arrangement may be where the AMLSP Direct Customer is acting as the Governing body for one legal arrangement. For example, where the AMLSP Direct Customer is a SPV trustee, or SPV general partner, without employees other than directors.

    **71.** Some examples of circumstances where a n AMLSP arrangement in respect of a legal person acting for itself and a legal arrangement may not be appropriate include:

    - Where the trustee or the general partner are businesses with presence in the island which have their own employees;
    - Where the trustees or the general partner provide services to multiple legal arrangements/funds; or
    - Where the complexity, frequency or risks posed by the fund require a more subjective bespoke approach.

    **72.** Section 13 of this Handbook provides additional information regarding funds and fund operators, with section 13.2.4 of this Handbook regarding risk-assessments for SPV governing bodies providing guidance regarding potential approaches to the consolidation of risk assessments for legal arrangements.
