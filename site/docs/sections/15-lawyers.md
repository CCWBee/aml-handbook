## 15. LAWYERS

## 15.1. Definition of Lawyers undertaking Supervised business

**1.** Paragraph 21 of Part 3 of Schedule 2 to the [Proceeds of Crime Law](https://www.jerseylaw.je/laws/current/l_8_1999) defines the relevant operations and activities of lawyers, notaries, and other independent legal professionals ( Lawyers ) for the purposes of the complying with the requirements of the [Money Laundering Order](https://www.jerseylaw.je/laws/current/ro_20_2008). Guidelines provide the interpretation and activities and operations of Lawyers that are in scope.

## 15.1.1. Activities to which the Money Laundering Order applies

**2.** Whilst the Money Laundering Order, the Guidelines and consequently this Handbook, only brings within its scope the business activities of law firms where they are carrying on a supervised business, the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Legislation and the general offences and penalties cover all persons and all business activities within Jersey. Consequently, law firms undertaking a significant proportion of supervised business may wish to consider applying the systems and controls to counter money laundering, the financing of terrorism, or the financing of proliferation across the whole of their business activities.

## 15.2. Business relationships and one-off transactions

Lawyers

**3.** This section is supplemental to and should be read in conjunction with sections 1.6 and 3.2 of this Handbook.

**4.** As noted above, where a relationship between a supervised person and a customer has no 'element of duration' and is not a one-off transaction within the meaning of Article 4 of the Money Laundering Order, identification measures within the meaning of Article 13 of the Money Laundering Order are not required unless:

- the supervised person suspects money laundering, the financing of terrorism or the financing of proliferation; or
- the supervised person has doubts about the veracity or adequacy of any documents, data or information previously obtained under the CDD measures.

!!! warning "AML/CFT/CPF Code of Practice"

    Lawyers

    **5.** In the circumstances set out in paragraph 4 above, the identity of the person undertaking the transaction must still be found out and recorded.

    **6.** A supervised person must record the basis that it has applied for determining the value of a transaction for the purposes of establishing whether it is a one-off transaction under Article 4 of the Money Laundering Order, and why that basis is appropriate.

    **7.** A supervised person must have in place measures to identify when linked transactions are being undertaken which would, in total, amount to € 15,000 or more (for all supervised persons save for MVTS, VASP, or those operating a casino where different thresholds apply as set out in Article 4(1)) of the Money Laundering Order, and therefore be a one-off transaction within the meaning of Article 4 of the Money Laundering Order. Supervised persons must also consider when the frequency of regular one-off transactions by the same customer would constitute a business relationship.

    **8.** A supervised person must consider the nature of those transactions which are determined not to be a one-off transaction for which identification measures are not required. Where these transactions are considered to present a higher risk of money laundering or the financing of terrorism or proliferation financing, consideration must be given to applying full CDD measures.

    **9.** A supervised person must be able to demonstrate that their decision not to apply identification measures in respect of such transactions was reasonable considering its business risk profile.


!!! info "Guidance"

    **10.** A supervised person may demonstrate that the basis upon which it has determined the value of a conveyancing transaction for the purposes of Article 4 of the Money Laundering Order is appropriate where it applies the value of the property that is the subject of the transaction.


## 15.3. Business Risk Assessment

Lawyers

## 15.3.1. Considering and assessing service area vulnerabilities and warning signs

Lawyers

**11.** The BRA relating to customers and services will depend on the supervised person's size, type of customers and the practice area it engages in.

**12.** Supervised persons carrying on supervised business specified at paragraph 21, Part 3 of Schedule 2 of the Proceeds of Crime Law ( Lawyers ) should consider the different types of risk to which they are exposed when providing services. The risks should be considered within the context that a supervised person may be used to launder funds or assets through that supervised person or, alternatively, that the customer or its counterparties may launder criminal funds or assets, but in a way that does not touch the supervised person. This service area risk assessment must also be reflected when undertaking a CRA.

**13.** The following sub-sections set out some key legal service area vulnerabilities drawn from FATF and law enforcement guidance and case studies, and some key warning signs that have been drawn up by the Law Society for England and Wales, as an indication of service area vulnerabilities. Further factors to consider when evaluating the risks posed by customers and service areas are set out in [section 3.3.4](03-identification-overview.md#334-assessment-of-risk-stage-21) of this Handbook.

## 15.3.1.1. Use of client accounts

!!! info "Guidance"

    Lawyers

    **14.** Lawyers should not provide a banking service for their customers. However, it can be difficult to draw a distinction between holding customer money for a legitimate transaction and acting more like a bank. For example, when the proceeds of a sale are left with a supervised person to make payments, these payments may be to mainstream lending companies, but may also be to more obscure recipients, including private individuals, whose identity is difficult or impossible to check.

    **15.** Situations which could give rise to cause for concern are detailed at [section 6.4.2.2](06-ongoing-monitoring.md#6422-changing-instructions) of this Handbook.

    **16.** Supervised persons should think carefully before disclosing client account details as this allows money to be deposited into a client account without the supervised person's knowledge. If it is necessary to provide account details, supervised persons should ask the customer where the funds will be coming from. Will it be an account in their name, from Jersey or another jurisdiction? Supervised persons should consider whether they are prepared to accept funds from any source that they are concerned about.

    **17.** Circulation of client account details should be kept to a minimum. Customers should be discouraged from passing the details on to third parties and should be asked to use the account details only for previously agreed purposes.


## 15.3.1.2. Establish a policy on handling cash

!!! info "Guidance"

    Lawyers

    **18.** It is good practice to establish a policy of not accepting cash payments above a certain limit either at the supervised person's office or into the supervised person's bank account. Customers may attempt to circumvent such a policy by depositing cash directly into a client account at a bank. Supervised persons may consider advising customers in such circumstances that they might encounter a delay in completion of the final transaction. Avoid disclosing client account details as far as possible and make it clear that electronic transfer of funds is expected.


## 15.3.1.3. Source of funds

!!! info "Guidance"

    Lawyers

    **19.** Accounts staff should monitor whether funds received from customers are from credible sources. For example, it is reasonable for monies to be received from a company if your customer is a director of that company and has the authority to use company money for the transaction.

    **20.** In some circumstances, cleared funds will be essential for transactions and customers may want to provide cash to meet a completion deadline. Supervised persons should assess the risk in these cases and ask more questions if necessary.


## 15.3.1.4. Private client work -Administration of estates

!!! info "Guidance"

    Lawyers

    **21.** A deceased person's estate is very unlikely to be actively utilised by criminals as a means for laundering their funds, however there is still a risk of money laundering, the financing of terrorism, or proliferation financing for those working in this area.

    **22.** When winding up an estate, there is no blanket requirement that supervised persons should be satisfied about the history of all the funds which make up the estate under administration. However, supervised persons should be aware of the factors which can increase money laundering, the financing of terrorism or proliferation financing risks and consider the following:

    - where estate assets have been earned in a foreign jurisdiction, supervised persons should be aware of the wide definition of criminal conduct in the Proceeds of Crime Law; and
    - where estate assets have been earned or are located in a higher risk country or territory, supervised persons may need to make further checks about the source of those funds.

    **23.** Supervised persons should be alert from the outset and monitor throughout so that any disclosure can be considered as soon as knowledge or suspicion is formed, and problems of delayed consent can be avoided (see [section 8.4](08-reporting-obligations.md#84-fiu-consent) of this Handbook ).

    **24.** Supervised persons should bear in mind that an estate may include criminal property. An extreme example would be where the supervised person knows or suspects that the deceased person was accused or convicted of acquisitive criminal conduct during their lifetime.

    **25.** If supervised persons know or suspect that the deceased person improperly claimed welfare benefit/allowances or had evaded the due payment of tax during their lifetime, criminal property will be included in the estate and so a money laundering disclosure may be required.

    **26.** Relevant local laws will apply before assets can be released. For example, a grant of probate will normally be required before UK assets can be released. Supervised persons should remain alert to warning signs, for example if the deceased or their business interests are based in a higher risk country or territory.

    **27.** If the deceased person is from another jurisdiction and a Lawyer is dealing with the matter in the home country, supervised persons may find it helpful to ask the Lawyer for information about the deceased to gain some assurances that there are no suspicious circumstances surrounding the estate. The issue of the tax payable on the estate may depend on the jurisdiction concerned.


## 15.3.1.5. Property transactions

!!! info "Guidance"

    Lawyers

    **28.** Criminal conduct generates huge amounts of illicit capital, and these criminal proceeds need to be integrated into personal lifestyles and business operations. Law enforcement agencies have advised that property purchases are one of the most frequently identified methods of money laundering. Property can be used either as a vehicle for money laundering or as a means of investing laundered funds.

    **29.** Criminals will buy property both for their own use, e.g., as principal residencies or second homes, business, or warehouse premises, and as investment vehicles to provide additional income.

    **30.** The purchase of real estate is commonly used as part of the last stage of money laundering. Such a purchase offers the criminal an investment which gives the appearance of financial stability. The purchase of a restaurant or hotel, for example, offers advantages as it is often a cash-intensive business, which is the preferred currency of criminals. Cash remains the mainstay of much serious organised criminal activity. It has the obvious advantage that it leaves no audit trail and is the most reliable form of payment, as well as the most flexible. Retail businesses also provide a good front for criminal funds where legitimate earnings can be mixed with the proceeds of crime.


## 15.3.1.6. Criminal use of conveyancing services

!!! info "Guidance"

    Lawyers

    **31.** Law enforcement agencies have advised that of all the services offered by Lawyers, conveyancing is the function most utilised by criminal groups. Conveyancing is a comparatively easy and efficient method of laundering money with relatively large amounts of criminal monies 'cleaned' in one transaction. In a stable or rising property market, the money launderer will incur no financial loss except fees. Conveyancing transactions can also be attractive to money launderers who are attempting to disguise the audit trail of the proceeds of their crimes. As the property itself can be 'criminal property' for the purposes of the Proceeds of Crime Law, Lawyers can still be involved in money laundering even if no money changes hands.

    **32.** Corrupt Lawyers may employ trainees to perform the conveyancing work for criminal groups, thereby distancing themselves from the criminal aspect of the business. Conveyancers should also be alert to instructions which are a deliberate attempt to avoid assets being dealt with in the way intended by the court or through the usual legal process. For example, Lawyers may sometimes suspect that instructions are being given to avoid the property forming part of a bankruptcy or forming part of assets subject to confiscation.


## 15.3.1.7. Ownership issues

!!! info "Guidance"

    Lawyers

    **33.** Properties owned by nominee companies or multiple owners may be used as money laundering vehicles to disguise the true owner and/or confuse the audit trail. Supervised persons should be alert to sudden or unexplained changes in ownership.

    **34.** Unexplained changes in ownership may indicate a form of money laundering known as 'flipping', which involves a property purchase, often using someone else's identity. The property is then quickly sold for a much higher price to the same buyer using another identity. The proceeds of crime are mixed with mortgage funds for the purchase. This process may be repeated several times.

    **35.** Another potential cause for concern is where a third party is providing the funding for a p urchase, but the property is being registered in someone else's name. There may be legitimate reasons for this, such as a family arrangement, but supervised persons should be alert to the possibility of being misled about the true ownership of the property. Further CDD measures should be undertaken on the person providing the funding.


## 15.3.1.8. Methods of funding

!!! info "Guidance"

    Lawyers

    **36.** Many properties are bought with a combination of deposit, mortgage and/or equity from a current property. Usually, the Lawyer acting for the purchaser will have information about how the customer intends to fund the transaction. Lawyers should expect to be updated if those details change, for example, if a mortgage falls through and new funding is obtained.

    **37.** Supervised persons should remember that payments made through the mainstream banking system are not guaranteed to be clean.

    **38.** Transactions that do not involve a mortgage or are not being financed wholly from the sale of a previous property have a higher risk of being fraudulent. Supervised persons should be alert for large payments from such private sources of funds, especially if the customer receives payments from several individuals or sources. If concerns arise:

    - the customer should be asked to explain the source of funds. Supervised persons should assess whether the explanation appears to be valid -e.g., the money has been received from an inheritance; and
    - supervised persons should ensure that the customer is the beneficial owner of the funds being used in the purchase. Documentary evidence should be obtained in support of the same.

    **39.** Settlements which are to be paid in cash -particularly where cash is to be passed directly between sellers and buyers without adequate explanation -may indicate money laundering, the financing of terrorism, or the financing of proliferation.

    **40.** Third parties often assist with purchases and supervised persons may be asked to receive funds directly from third parties, for example relatives often assist first time buyers. Consideration will need to be given as to the extent of due diligence that needs to be undertaken on those third parties. Supervised persons should consider whether there are any obvious warning signs and what needs to be known about:

    - the customer;
    - the third party;
    - their relationship; and
    - the proportion of the funding being provided by the third party.

    **41.** Supervised persons should consider their obligations to the mortgage lender in these circumstances -supervised persons are normally required to advise mortgage lenders if the buyers are not funding the balance of the price from their own resources.


## 15.3.1.9. Valuations

!!! info "Guidance"

    Lawyers

    **42.** An unusual sale price can be an indicator of money laundering. Whilst Lawyers acting in a property sale are not required to get independent valuations, if a supervised person becomes aware of a significant discrepancy between the sale price and what a property would reasonably be asked to sell for, consideration should be given to asking more questions.

    **43.** Properties may also be sold below the market value to an associate, with a view to obscuring the title to the property while the original owner still maintains the Beneficial ownership.


## 15.3.1.10. Mortgage Fraud

!!! info "Guidance"

    Lawyers

    **44.** A supervised person may discover or suspect that a customer is attempting to mislead a lender to improperly inflate a mortgage advance -for example, by misrepresenting the borrower's income or because the seller and buyer are conspiring to overstate the sale price. Transactions which a re not at arm's length may warrant particular consideration. However, until the improperly obtained mortgage advance is received, there is not any criminal property for the purposes of disclosure obligations to the FIU.

    **45.** If a supervised person suspects that a customer is making a misrepresentation to a mortgage lender, the supervised person must either dissuade them from doing so or consider the ethical implications of continuing with the retainer. Even if a supervised person no longer acts for the customer, it may still be under a duty to advise the mortgage lender.

    **46.** Large scale mortgage fraud is more sophisticated and will normally involve several properties. It may be committed by criminal groups or by individuals. The buy-to-let market is particularly vulnerable to large scale mortgage fraud, whether through new-build apartment complexes or large-scale renovation properties. Occasionally commercial properties will be involved.

    **47.** Fraudsters may use private sources of funding such as property clubs, especially when credit market conditions tighten. These lenders often have lower safeguards than institutional lenders, leaving them vulnerable to organised fraud. Property clubs can be targeted particularly in relation to overseas properties where the property either does not exist, or is a vacant piece of land, not a developed property.

    **48.** Sometimes fraud is achieved by selling the property between related private companies. The transactions will involve inflated values and will not be at arm's length. Increasingly, of fshore companies are used with the property sold several times within the group before approaching a lender for a mortgage at an inflated value.

    **49.** Supervised persons that discover or suspect that a mortgage advance has already been improperly obtained should consider advising the mortgage lender.

    **50.** Supervised persons acting in connection with a re-mortgage who discover or suspect that a previous mortgage has been improperly obtained may need to advise the lender, especially if the remortgage is with the same lender. Consideration should also be given to making a disclosure to the FIU as the improperly obtained mortgage advance represents criminal property.

    **51.** If a customer has made a deliberate misrepresentation on their mortgage application, it is likely that the crime/fraud exemption to legal professional privilege will apply (see section 15.5.1 of this Handbook ). This means that no waiver of confidentiality will be needed before a disclosure is made. However, such matters will need to be dealt with on a case-by-case basis.


## 15.3.1.11. Company and commercial work

!!! info "Guidance"

    Lawyer s

    **52.** The nature of company structures can make them attractive to money launderers because it is possible to obscure true ownership and protect assets for relatively little expense. For this reason, Lawyers working with companies and in commercial transactions should remain alert throughout their business relationships, with existing as well as new customers.

    **53.** A common operating method amongst serious organised criminals is the use of front companies. These are often used to disguise criminal proceeds as representing the legitimate profits of fictitious business activities. They can also help to make the transportation of suspicious cargoes appear as genuine goods being traded. Often, they are used to mask the identity of the true beneficial owners and the source of criminally obtained assets. Corporate vehicles are also frequently used to help commit tax fraud, facilitate bribery/corruption, shield assets from creditors, facilitate fraud generally or circumvent disclosure requirements.

    **54.** The lack of transparency concerning the Beneficial ownership and control of corporate vehicles has proved to be a consistent problem for money laundering investigations. Corporations acting as directors and nominee directors can be used to conceal the identity of the natural persons who manage and control a corporate vehicle.

    **55.** Several international reports have highlighted the extent to which private limited companies, shell companies, bearer shares, nominees, front companies, and SPVs have been used in money laundering operations. Case studies submitted to the FATF have indicated the following common elements in the misuse of corporate vehicles:

    - multi-jurisdictional and/or complex structures of corporate entities and trusts;
    - foreign payments without a clear connection to the actual activities of the corporate entity;
    - use of offshore bank accounts without clear economic necessity;
    - use of nominees;
    - use of shell companies;
    - tax, financial and legal advisers were generally involved in developing and establishing the structure. In some case studies a Lawyer was involved who specialised in providing illicit services for customers.

    **56.** The more of the above elements that exist, the greater the likelihood and the risk that the identity of the underlying beneficial owner may be able to remain unidentifiable.


## 15.3.1.12. Shell corporations

!!! info "Guidance"

    Lawyers

    **57.** The shell corporation is a tool that appears to be widely used by criminals. Often purchased 'off -theshelf', it can be a convenient vehicle for money laundering and for concealing the identity of the beneficial owner of the funds. The company records are often more difficult for law enforcement to access because they are held behind a veil of professional privilege or the professionals who run the company act on instructions remotely and anonymously.

    **58.** Shell companies are often used to receive deposits of cash which are then transferred to another jurisdiction, to facilitate false invoicing or to purchase real estate and other assets. They have also been used as the vehicle for the actual predicate offence of bankruptcy fraud on many occasions.


## 15.3.1.13. Bearer shares

!!! info "Guidance"

    Lawyers

    **59.** Bearer shares confer rights of ownership to a company upon the physical holder of the share. They are commonly and legitimately used in several countries. However, the high level of anonymity that bearer shares offer provides opportunities for misuse where the identity of the shareholder is not recorded when the share is issued and transferred, ownership of the share is effectively anonymous.

    **60.** Such shares are open to two money laundering risks:

    - financial assets can be acquired without the purchaser being identified; and
    - the company owners and controllers may not be capable of being identified.

    **61.** To guard against misuse, several jurisdictions have dematerialised or immobilised bearer shares when they are registered in an effort to ensure that the identity of the Beneficial owners can be verified. Dematerialisation is achieved by requiring registration upon transfer or requiring registration to vote or collect dividends. While physical transfer of bearer shares is possible, it is believed to be rare.


## 15.3.1.14. Private equity

!!! info "Guidance"

    Lawyers

    **62.** Lawyers could be involved in any of the following circumstances:

    - the start-up phase of a private equity business where individuals or companies seek to establish a private equity firm (and in certain cases, become authorised to conduct investment business);
    - the formation of a private equity fund;

    - ongoing legal issues relating to a private equity fund;
    - execution of transactions on behalf of a member of a private equity firm's group of companies (a private equity sponsor that will normally involve a vehicle company acting on its behalf).

    **63.** Private equity work may be considered to be low risk for money laundering, the financing of terrorism, or the financing of proliferation for the following reasons:

    - private equity firms are also covered by the Money Laundering Order and similar legislation in equivalent jurisdictions;
    - investors are generally large institutions, some of which will also be regulated for money laundering purposes;
    - there are generally detailed due diligence processes followed prior to investors being accepted;
    - the investment is generally illiquid and the return of capital is unpredictable;
    - the terms of the investment in the fund generally strictly control the transfer of interests and the return of funds to investors.

    **64.** Factors which may alter this risk assessment include:

    - where the private equity firm, fund manager or an investor is located in a jurisdiction which is not regulated for money laundering to a standard which is equivalent to the FATF Recommendations;
    - where the investor is either an individual or an investment vehicle itself (a private equity fund of funds);
    - where the private equity firm is seeking to raise funds for the first time or is approaching a large investor base.

Lawyers

## The MLRO

**65.** This section is supplemental to and should be read in conjunction with [section 2.7](02-corporate-governance.md#27-the-mlro) of this Handbook.

**66.** [Section 2.7](02-corporate-governance.md#27-the-mlro) of this Handbook sets out statutory requirements under the Money Laundering Order and AML/CFT/CPF Codes of Practice regarding the appointment a MLRO and, where relevant, Deputy MLROs.

!!! warning "AML/CFT/CPF Code of Practice"

    Lawyers

    **67.** A supervised person must ensure that the MLRO maintains a record of all enquiries received from law enforcement authorities.


## 15.5. Identification measures: Finding out identity and obtaining evidence

Lawyers

## 15.5.1. Timing of identification measures

**68.** [Section 4.7](04-identification-measures.md#47-timing-of-identification-measures) of this Handbook sets out statutory requirements under the Money Laundering Order regarding when identification measures must be applied, in respect of a business relationship or one-off transaction.

**69.** Article 13(4) of the Money Laundering Order allows, in certain circumstances, a supervised person a reasonable timeframe to undertake the necessary enquiries for obtaining evidence of identity after the initial establishment of a relationship.

**70.** A relationship is considered to be established as soon as a supervised person undertakes to act on instructions as to the operation of that relationship, for example, by receiving and accepting signed terms of business from the customer.

**71.** Where the provision of supervised business by the Lawyer is urgent, this undertaking may be provided prior to obtaining evidence of identity if there is little risk of money laundering, the financing of terrorism, or proliferation financing occurring, and evidence of identity is obtained as soon as reasonably practicable. Nevertheless, identity is still required to be found out.

## 15.5.2. Timing for 'existing clients'

Lawyers

**72.** This sector-specific section is supplementary to and should be read in conjunction with [section 4.7.2](04-identification-measures.md#472-timing-for-existing-customers) of this Handbook.

**73.** For the purposes of the Money Laundering Order, an existing customer means a business relationship established before the Money Laundering Order came into force for Lawyers on 1 May 2008 and which continues.

**74.** For the avoidance of doubt, the identification measures (finding out identity and obtaining evidence) to be applied to existing customers include the collection of information that is necessary to assess the risk that a business relationship involves money laundering, the financing of terrorism, or the financing of proliferation (in line with Article 3(5) of the Money Laundering Order ). This is likely to be self-evident for an existing customer on the basis that a relationship will have been established on, or before, 30 April 2008.

**75.** Except with the agreement of the JFSC, (in relation to an application from the supervised person made on or before 31 December 2014), the effect of Article 13(3A) of the Money Laundering Order is to require the identity of a customer to have been found out by 31 December 2014. There is no similar deadline for obtaining evidence of identity.

**76.** Once an e xisting relationship has been 'remediated', then Article 13(1)(c)(ii) of the Money Laundering Order will apply to such a relationship in the same way as a relationship established on or after 1 May 2008 (on the basis that documents, data or information will have been obtained under the CDD measures prescribed in Article 3 of the Money Laundering Order).

## 15.5.3. Ascertaining legal position

Lawyers

**77.** [Section 4.8](04-identification-measures.md#48-failure-to-complete-identification-measures) above sets out the statutory requirements under the Money Laundering Order to terminate a business relationship or not carry out a one-off transaction where a supervised person is unable to apply identification measures in respect of that relationship or one-off transaction.

**78.** A concession from terminating a business relationship is permitted for Accountant s, Lawyers and other professional advisers who are in the course of ascertaining the legal position for their customer or performing the task of defending or representing their customer in legal proceedings (including advice on instigating or avoiding proceedings).

**79.** To qualify for the concession the Accountant, Lawyer or other professional adviser must be a member of a relevant professional body that undertakes competency testing for its members and imposes and maintains professional and ethical standards.

!!! danger "Statutory Requirement"

    Lawyers

    **80.** Article 14(9) of the Money Laundering Order provides that the prohibition from continuing a business relationship does not apply where the relevant person is a lawyer or other business falling within paragraphs 21 or 22 of Part 3 of Schedule 2 to the Proceeds of Crime Law and is in the course of ascertaining the legal position for that person's client or performing the task of defending or representing the client in, or concerning legal proceedings, including advice on instituting or avoiding proceedings.


!!! info "Guidance"

    **81.** CDD information will still need to be collected within a reasonable timescale to comply with Article 13 of the Money Laundering Order.

    **82.** Accountants, Lawyers, and other relevant professional advisers are encouraged to consider their position very carefully before applying the above concession to ensure that the type of work and their professional status falls within the conditions contained in Article 14(9) of the Money Laundering Order.

    **83.** For example, the concession applies to litigation but not transactional work, so Lawyers should be mindful of the distinction between advice, litigation work and transactional work.


## 15.6. Exemptions from CDD measures

Lawyers

## 15.6.1. Exemption from applying third party identification requirements in relation to certain relevant customers involved in Trust Company Business

**84.** This section is supplemental to and should be read in conjunction with [section 7.15](07-enhanced-simplified-cdd.md) of this Handbook.

**85.** Article 17C(1)(c)(ii) of the Money Laundering Order provides that a supervised person that is a Lawyer is exempt from applying third party identification requirements in relation to a third party for which a relevant customer is acting if the relevant customer carries on Trust Company Business and is registered to carry on such business under the FS(J) Law, or equivalent business.

**86.** Article 17C(2) of the Money Laundering Order requires that a supervised person who does not apply third party identification requirements must be satisfied, by reason of the nature of the relationship with the relevant customer, that there is little risk of money laundering, terrorism financing, or proliferation financing occurring.

!!! info "Guidance"

    **87.** In relation to the exemption set out at Article 17C(1)(c)(ii) of the Money Laundering Order, a supervised person may be satisfied that there is little risk of money laundering, the financing of terrorism, or the financing of proliferation occurring where:

    - The service provided to a Trust Company Business relevant customer is drafting (including incidental reviewing and advising (insofar as the Money Laundering Order is applicable)) of one or more of the following and
    - It considers the extent of the service provided.
    - In respect of trusts (except employee benefit schemes) administered by a relevant customer carrying on Trust Company Business, the service provided by the supervised person is drafting:

    - factual confirmations covering matters such as the existence and status of a trust (or other vehicle by which the scheme is structured) and its capacity to enter into transactional documentation.
    - In respect of a foundation administered by a relevant customer carrying on Trust Company Business, the service provided by the supervised person is drafting:
    - statutory forms;
    - charters and regulations;
    - supplemental deeds of:

    - initial and further endowments;
    - transfers of assets;
    - indemnities and releases;
    - distributions;
    - amendments and variations;
    - changes of proper law;
    - continuance and mergers, revocation, termination, winding up or dissolution;
    - appointment/removal of guardian or any other person appointed under the regulations of the foundation to carry out a function in respect of the foundation;
    - guardian sanctioning of council actions;
    - addition and removal of beneficiaries and changes of purposes;
    - addition, amendment, removal, exercise, assignment of founders' rights;
    - appointment and removal of council members;
    - releases of powers;
    - delegation of council powers.
    - factual confirmations covering matters such as the existence and status of a foundation and its capacity to enter into transactional documentation.

    **88.** The above is not intended to be an exhaustive list of documents for which drafting services are provided and a supervised person may be able to demonstrate that other drafting services present little risk of money laundering, terrorist financing, or proliferation financing.

    **89.** A supervised person may demonstrate that it has considered the extent of the service provided to the relevant customer when it considers:

    - whether the service provided is 'off the shelf' or bespoke;
    - the need for and extent to which an 'off the shelf' service is to be modified; and
    - the fee that is to be charged.

    **90.** For example, the provision of a standard trust deed that requires very little modification, may be described as 'off the shelf' and attracts only a nominal fee, may be illustrative of a relationship presenting little risk of money laundering. By contrast, the provision of a bespoke trust deed that requires detailed information on the trust to be collected and which attracts more than a nominal fee, may not.

    **93.** For each case described in Article 18 of the Money Laundering Order, a supervised person must obtain information on the purpose and intended nature of the business relationship or one-off transaction.

    **94.** A supervised person that is a lawyer must obtain and retain documentation establishing that its customer is entitled to benefit from the exemption set out in Article 18(6) of the Money Laundering Order.

**95.** This section is supplemental to and should be read in conjunction with the AML/CFT/CPF Codes of Practice and Guidance notes set out at [section 8](08-reporting-obligations.md) of this Handbook.

## 15.7.1. Legal Professional Privilege (LPP)

**96.** Lawyers are under a duty to keep the affairs of their customers confidential, and the circumstances in which they can disclose customer communications are strictly limited.

**97.** However, the Proceeds of Crime Law and Terrorism Law contain provisions requiring the disclosure of confidential information in certain circumstances to the police (or a MLRO/Deputy MLRO ) by persons working in supervised businesses. These laws also provide individuals working for law firms which conduct supervised business with certain defences against proceedings for breaching any duty of confidentiality, or for an offence such as money laundering, if they make a disclosure to the police or to a MLRO/Deputy MLRO in accordance with the procedures set down by their employer.

**98.** This section examines some of the tensions which may arise between a Lawyer 's duty of confidentiality to their customer and the disclosure requirements set out in the Proceeds of Crime Law and Terrorism Law.

!!! danger "Statutory Requirement"

    Lawyers

    **99.** Article 34D of the Proceeds of Crime Law and Article 21 of the Terrorism Law contain comparable provisions. Those provisions provide that a person employed in a supervised business commits an offence if they come into possession of information in the course of that business which leads them to know or suspect, or have reasonable grounds to know or suspect, that another person is engaged in money laundering (e.g. the offences set out at Articles 30 and 31 of the Proceeds of Crime Law) or is committing an offence under Articles 15 and 16 of the Terrorism Law, or conduct outside Jersey which if occurring in Jersey would constitute one of the above offences. The offence is committed, unless the person reports their knowledge, suspicion or reasonable grounds to the FIU or to the MLRO (or Deputy MLRO) in accordance with their employer's procedures.

    **100.** The Money Laundering Order requires that any person who conducts a financial services business in Jersey must have procedures in place for reporting such knowledge or suspicion to the FIU.

    **101.** However, the Proceeds of Crime Law and Terrorism Law also include exemptions from the requirement to make such disclosures for professional legal advisers acting in privileged circumstances (see Article 34D(5) of the Proceeds of Crime Law, for example). Legal privilege is defined in the three laws referenced above. The exemptions do not apply to information or other matters communicated or given with a view to furthering a criminal purpose.

    **102.** Article 35 of the Proceeds of Crime Law and Article 35 of the Terrorism Law prohibit disclosure of information in circumstances where a suspicious activity report has been made and/or where it would prejudice an existing or proposed investigation. However, an exception is also provided in respect of these offences where a professional legal adviser discloses any information or other matter:

    - to a customer or to a representative of a customer of the legal adviser in connection with the giving of legal advice by the adviser to the customer; or
    - to any person for the purpose of actual or contemplated legal proceedings.
    - Again, this exemption does not apply in relation to any information or other matter that is disclosed with a view to furthering a criminal purpose.


## 15.7.1.1. Duty of confidentiality

**103.** Lawyers are professionally and legally obliged to keep the affairs of their customers confidential. This obligation extends to all matters revealed to a Lawyer, from whatever source, by a customer or someone acting on the customer's behalf.

**104.** In exceptional circumstances, this obligation may be overridden. The most relevant instances are where a court orders disclosure or disclosure is required by statute.

## 15.7.1.2. Application of LPP

**105.** Certain confidential communications between a Lawyer and their customer will fall into a category known as LPP. LPP is a privilege against disclosure, ensuring customers know that certain documents and information provided to Lawyers cannot be disclosed without the customer's consent. It recognises a customer's right to be open with their legal adviser, without fear of later disclosure to their prejudice. LPP cannot be overridden by any other public interest but can be waived or overridden by statute.

106. LPP only covers those confidential communications falling under either advice privilege or litigation privilege. It does not cover all information/matters which Lawyers have a duty to keep confidential.

**107.** For the purposes of LPP, the term ' Lawyers ' includes Advocates, Écrivains, barristers, solicitors, in-house Lawyers, and their employees.

## 15.7.1.3. Advice Privilege

!!! info "Guidance"

    Lawyers

    **108.** Communications between a Lawyer and a customer are subject to advice privilege if:

    - the Lawyer is communicating with the customer in their capacity as a Lawyer;
    - the communications are confidential; and
    - the communications are being made for the purpose of seeking advice from a lawyer or providing it to a customer.

    **109.** Communications are not privileged simply because a customer is speaking or writing to their Lawyer. The protection applies only to those communications which directly seek or provide advice, or which are given in a legal context, that involve the Lawyer using their legal skills and which are directly related to the performance of the Lawyer 's professional duties.

    **110.** Some examples of what is/is not covered by advice privilege, as established through case law, are set out below:

    - communications subject to advice privilege:
    - a Lawyer 's bill of costs and statement of account;
    - information imparted by prospective customers in advance of a retainer, if the communications were made for the purpose of indicating the advice required.
    - communications not subject to advice privilege:
    - notes of open court proceedings are not privileged as the content of the communication is not confidential;
    - a client account ledger maintained in relation to the customer's money;
    - an appointments diary or time record on an attendance note, time sheet or fee record relating to a customer;
    - conveyancing documents (these documents are not communicated and therefore are not subject to advice privilege).


## 15.7.1.4. Advice within a transaction

**111.** All communications between a Lawyer and their customer relating to a transaction in which the Lawyer has been instructed for the purpose of obtaining legal advice are covered by advice privilege, provided that they are directly related to the performance by the Lawyer of their professional duty as legal adviser of their customer.

**112.** This means that where a Lawyer is providing legal advice in a transactional matter (such as conveyancing) the advice privilege will cover all:

- communications with;
- instructions from; and
- advice given to;

The customer, including any working papers and drafts prepared, as long as they are directly related to the Lawyer 's performance of their professional duties as a legal adviser.

## 15.7.1.5. Litigation Privilege

!!! info "Guidance"

    Lawyers

    **113.** Litigation privilege is wider than advice privilege and protects confidential communications made in pursuance or contemplation of litigation, between either:

    - a Lawyer and a customer;
    - a Lawyer and an agent, whether or not that agent is a Lawyer; or
    - a Lawyer and a third party.

    **114.** Such communications must be for the sole or dominant purpose of litigation, namely:

    - for seeking or giving advice in relation to it;
    - for obtaining evidence to be used in it; or
    - for obtaining information leading to obtaining such evidence.


## 15.7.1.6. What is covered by LPP -Further points to consider

**115.** An original document not brought into existence for privileged purposes, and thus not already privileged, does not become privileged simply by being given to a Lawyer for advice or another privileged purpose.

**116.** Furthermore, where a Lawyer has a customer which is a body corporate, communication between the Lawyer and the employees of the corporate customer may not be protected by LPP if those employees are not considered to be the customer for the purpose of the retainer. As such, some employees will be customers, while others will not.

**117.** It is not a breach of LPP to discuss a matter with your MLRO (or Deputy MLRO ) for the purpose of receiving guidance on whether to make a disclosure. Privilege will continue to apply whilst such a determination is being made.

## 15.7.1.7. Crime/Fraud Exception

!!! info "Guidance"

    Lawyers

    **118.** LPP protects advice a Lawyer gives to a customer on avoiding committing a crime or warning them that proposed actions could attract prosecution. LPP does not extend to documents which themselves form part of a criminal or fraudulent act, or communications which take place in order to obtain advice with the intention of carrying out an offence. It is irrelevant whether or not the Lawyer is aware that they are being used for that purpose.

    **119.** Article 32 of the Proceeds of Crime Law and Article 22 of the Terrorism Law provide that, if a Lawyer discloses information under those laws, the disclosure will not be treated as a breach of any restriction on disclosure contained in any statute, contract or otherwise.

    **120.** It is not just a customer's intention which is relevant for ascertaining whether information was communicated for the furtherance of a criminal purpose. In addition to the circumstances described above, LPP also does not extend to a situation where a third party intends the Lawyer -customer communication to be made for the furtherance of a criminal purpose (e.g., the innocent customer is being used by a criminal third party).


## 15.7.1.8. Determining when to submit a SAR

**121.** The reporting obligations and offences contained in Article 34D of the Proceeds of Crime Law and Article 21 of the Terrorism Law do not apply to a Lawyer 's knowledge or suspicion, or reasonable grounds for knowledge or suspicion, arising from information obtained in 'privileged circumstances' (as defined by the above laws). The Money Laundering Order also makes a provision in respect of privileged circumstances at Article 21(5). A Lawyer may, however, wish to consider making a joint report with their customer. The agreement of the Lawyer 's customer to waive LPP is necessary for this to be possible.

**122.** If information leading to knowledge, suspicion or reasonable grounds for knowledge or suspicion is obtained in circumstances that are not covered by LPP, a disclosure should be made to avoid the commission of an offence of failing to disclose. Lawyers will not be in breach of their professional duty of confidentiality if they make a report in these circumstances.

**123.** If a Lawyer commits an offence under Article 30 of the Proceeds of Crime Law or Article 16 of the Terrorism Law they should make a disclosure to the FIU or their MLRO / Deputy MLRO, otherwise they will not be able to avail themselves to the defences which operate under those Articles.

**124.** As the application of LPP is complex, supervised persons carrying on legal business may wish to consider maintaining procedures which require reports to be made to the MLRO (or Deputy MLRO ) on each occasion that there is knowledge, suspicion, or reasonable grounds to suspect money laundering or the financing of terrorism. The MLRO (or Deputy MLRO ) can then discuss the situation with the employee concerned and, as necessary, take advice from an appropriate partner.

## 15.7.1.9. CDD measures and LPP

!!! info "Guidance"

    Lawyers

    **125.** To assist in complying with the requirements of the Proceeds of Crime Law, supervised persons carrying on legal business may wish to consider separating all material on customer files so that it is clear what material is non-privileged and what material is covered by LPP.

    **126.** CDD and risk assessment documents should be completed, where possible, in a way which distinguishes privileged and non-privileged information. Supervised persons carrying on legal business may wish to consider including guidance to this effect in their procedures. This will assist in ensuring that the JFSC can request information from and conduct examinations of supervised persons with the minimum disruption to business, thus aiding in the supervised person's compliance with their obligations to the JFSC.
