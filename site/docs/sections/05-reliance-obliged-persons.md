# Section 5 - Identification Measures - Reliance on Obliged Persons

**1.** In some strictly limited cases, a supervised person may meet its obligation to comply with Articles 13(1)(a) or (c)(ii) ( CDD ); 15(1)(a), (b), (d), (e) or (g) ( Enhanced CDD measures ); or 15A ( Enhanced CDD Measures in relation to PEPs ) of the Money Laundering Order, and AML/CFT/CPF Codes of Practice by placing reliance on measures that have already been applied by an obliged person to find out the identity of a mutual customer and to obtain evidence of identity.

**2.** To consider what reliance might be placed on an obliged person, a supervised person will first need to determine what elements of identity must be found out and what evidence of identity is to be obtained for its customer. It will do so in accordance with Article 3 of the Money Laundering Order and the AML/CFT/CPF Codes of Practice set out in sections 3, 4 and 7 of this Handbook, and will also consider its risk assessment for the customer. Once it has determined what identification measures it is to apply, a supervised person can then consider whether those measures have already been applied by an obliged person.

**3.** Where an obliged person has met its customer, who is resident in the same country or territory as the obliged person, the measures that it has taken to find out identity and to obtain evidence of identity will be different to the identification measures that must be applied by the supervised person in a case where the supervised person is resident in a different country or territory to the obliged person and customer, and where it has not met its customer. Even in a case where the supervised person and obliged person have met a customer and are resident in the same country or territory, the measures taken by the obliged person may still differ to those to be applied by the supervised person to the extent that other factors are different, for example the nature of the product or service to be provided.

**4.** The effect of this is that the obliged person may not have found out all the same information on identity as the supervised person needs and may have obtained evidence of identity using different documents, data, or information. This means that, in practice, the scope to place reliance may sometimes be quite limited, and that it may be necessary for a supervised person to find out more information on identity and obtain evidence for that aspect of identity itself.

**5.** However, it is not necessary for the obliged person to have found out identity or obtained evidence of identity exactly in line with policies and procedures applied by the supervised person, since Guidance notes in section 4 of this Handbook provide that there are different ways in which to apply identification measures. Also, where the obliged person is outside Jersey, different requirements and guidance will be applicable.

**6.** Where an obliged person meets the requirements outlined in Article 16 of the Money Laundering Order, a supervised person is permitted to place reliance on the obliged person to have found out the identity and to have obtained evidence of the identity of:

- the supervised person's customer;
- any Beneficial owner and/or controller of that customer;
- any third party for which that customer is acting;
- any Beneficial owner and/or controller of a third party for whom that customer is acting;

- any person purporting to act on behalf of that customer.

**7.** It is not possible to place reliance on an obliged person to obtain information on the purpose and intended nature of a business relationship or one-off transaction, nor to apply on-going monitoring during a business relationship.

**8.** As noted above, overall CDD is always required to be undertaken by the supervised person. However, set out below are two tables summarising the elements of CDD that, in the absence of other provisions, the supervised person is required to undertake itself:

**9.** Article 16 of the Money Laundering Order cannot be applied in any case where:

- a supervised person suspects money laundering, the financing of terrorism, or proliferation financing;
- a supervised person considers that there is a higher risk of money laundering, the financing of terrorism, or proliferation financing based on a risk assessment carried out under Article 16(4) of the Money Laundering Order (see section 5.1.1 of this Handbook ); or
- the obliged person has a relevant connection to an enhanced risk state (see section 7.5 of this Handbook ).

**10.** Whilst the information on identity found out by the obliged person must be provided to the supervised person immediately before establishing a business relationship or carrying out a one-off transaction, a supervised person is not also required to immediately obtain evidence of identity. Evidence of identity may be held by an obliged person, so long as the supervised person is satisfied that the obliged person will provide the evidence that it holds, on request and without delay. However, it is not uncommon for evidence of identity to be called for at the same time as information on identity is provided by the obliged person.

**11.** Examples of obliged persons include, but are not limited to:

- an investment advisor who arranges for a customer to invest in a financial product provided by a supervised person, where the investment is to be held in the name of the customer and not that of the investment advisor;
- a Trust Company Business who establishes a bank or investment account for a client company, trust or foundation;
- a law firm that is a supervised person carrying on supervised business;

| CDD element | Always required to be undertaken by the supervised person |
|---------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Identification | Risk assessment. |
| measures | Obtain information on purpose/nature. |
| On-going monitoring | Scrutinising transactions/activity. Keep documents/information up to date. |

| CDD element | Article 16(2) of the Money Laundering Order allows reliance upon an obliged person | Article 16(2) of the Money Laundering Order allows reliance upon an obliged person |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Identification measures | Identify customer. | Identify customer. |
| Identification measures | Identify third parties. | Identify third parties. |
| Identification measures | Identify person acting for customer. | Verify authority to act. |
| Identification measures | Where customer not individual: | Understand ownership/control structure. |
| Identification measures | | Identify Beneficial owners/controllers. |

- an accountancy firm that is a supervised person carrying on supervised business.

**12.** A supervised person will remain responsible for the satisfactory performance of all elements of reliance identification measures.

**13.** However, where the measures taken by a supervised person are reasonable, it will have a defence should the obliged person fail to have performed satisfactory measures.

**14.** Outsourcing arrangements and the appointment of AMLSP to provide AMLSP services ( AMLSP arrangements) are not included within the scope of this section, as these are distinct from circumstances in which reliance is placed on an obliged person. In an outsourcing arrangement/ AMLSP arrangement, notwithstanding that the service provider may have substantial contact with the customer, the customer ' s direct relationship is with the supervised person. The service provider services will perform the outsourced/ AMLSP services on behalf of the supervised person according to the terms of a contract with the supervised person. An example of a typical outsourcing arrangement is where a trustee of a Collective investment scheme outsources the management of the scheme to an external party.

**15.** Whether a supervised person in receipt of outsourced services/ AMLSP services can be an obliged person will need to be assessed on a case-by-case basis, noting that while a supervised person using an AMLSP may be an equivalent business, it will not be a regulated business.

**16.** Where information on identity found out, or evidence of that identity, is passed by an obliged person to a supervised person to comply with requirements to counter money laundering and the financing of terrorism, the Data Protection (Jersey) Law 2018 restricts the use of the information to that purpose, except where another condition for processing personal data applies.

**17.** A customer may be an individual (or group of individuals) or legal person. Section 4.3 of this Handbook deals with a customer who is an individual (or group of individuals), section 4.4 of this Handbook deals with a customer (an individual or legal person) who is acting for a legal arrangement, and section 4.5 of this Handbook deals with a customer who is a legal person.

**18.** Under Article 16(1) of the Money Laundering Order, in this s ection ' customer of the obliged person ' means:

- a customer of the obliged person;
- a Beneficial owner and/or controller of that customer;
- a third party for whom that customer is acting;
- a Beneficial owner and/or controller of a third party for whom that customer is acting;
- a person purporting to act on behalf of that customer.

!!! danger "Statutory Requirement"

    **19.** In some strictly limited circumstances, Article 16(2) of the Money Laundering Order provides that a relevant person may be considered to have applied the reliance identification measures where such measures have already been applied by an obliged person. Obliged person means a person who the relevant person knows or has reasonable grounds for believing is:

    - a relevant person in respect of whom the JFSC discharges supervisory functions that is overseen for AML/CFT compliance in Jersey;
    - a person who carries on equivalent business (refer to section 1.9 of this Handbook).

    **20.** Reliance must always be subject to a number of conditions.

    **21.** The first condition (Article 16(2)(a) of the Money Laundering Order) is that the obliged person consents to being relied upon.

    **22.** The second condition (Article 16(4) of the Money Laundering Order) is that identification measures have been applied by the obliged person in the course of an established business relationship or one-off transaction.

    **23.** The third condition (Article 16(4)(a),(b),(c) and (d) of the Money Laundering Order) is that the relevant person obtains adequate assurance in writing that the obliged person:

    - has applied reliance identification measures in relation to the customer;
    - has not itself relied upon another party to have applied any reliance identification measures;
    - has not, in reliance on any provision in Part 3A of the Money Laundering Order (or if the obliged person is not in Jersey, a provision of similar effect), applied measures that are less than equivalent to the reliance identification measures;
    - is required to keep, and does keep, evidence of the identification as described in Article 3(4)(b) of the Money Laundering Order relating to each of the obliged person's customers, including a record of such evidence.

    **24.** The fourth condition (Article 16(2)(b) of the Money Laundering Order) is that the obliged person immediately provides the relevant person with the information obtained from applying the reliance identification measures.

    **25.** To the extent that reliance is placed on an obliged person to keep hold of the evidence obtained under reliance identification measures, the fifth condition (Article 16(5) of the Money Laundering Order) is that the relevant person obtains adequate assurance in writing that the obliged person will:

    - keep that evidence until the evidence has been provided to the relevant person, or until notification is received from the relevant person that the evidence is no longer required to be kept;
    - provide that evidence to the relevant person at its request, and without delay.

    **26.** The sixth condition (Article 16(3) of the Money Laundering Order) is that, immediately before placing reliance, the relevant person assesses the risk of placing reliance and makes a written record as to the reason why it is appropriate for it to place reliance on the obliged person, having regard to:

    - the higher risk of money laundering or the financing of terrorism should the obliged person fail to carry out any action specified in the assurances obtained under paragraphs 23 and 25 above;
    - the risk that an obliged person will fail to provide the relevant person with evidence without delay if requested to do so by the relevant person. See section 5.1.1 of this Handbook.

    **27.** Under Article 16(8) of the Money Laundering Order a relevant person who relies on an obliged person under this Article must conduct tests in such manner and at such intervals as the relevant person considers appropriate in all the circumstances to establish whether:

    - the obliged person has appropriate and consistent policies and procedures in place to apply reliance identification measures;
    - if the obliged person has not already provided the evidence to the relevant person, the obliged person does keep the evidence they have obtained during the course of applying reliance identification measures in respect of a person;

    - the obliged person will provide that evidence without delay if requested to do so.

    **28.** Under Article 16(8)(c) of the Money Laundering Order, testing should take into consideration whether the obliged person may be prevented, by application of law, from providing information or evidence, e.g. secrecy legislation.

    **29.** If, as a result of carrying out any such test, a relevant person is not satisfied that the obliged person has appropriate and consistent policies and procedures in place, keeps evidence, or will provide it without delay if requested to do so, in that particular case, Article 16(9) of the Money Laundering Order requires the relevant person to apply reliance identification measures immediately.

    **30.** Article 16(6)(a) of the Money Laundering Order provides that a written assurance will be adequate if it is reasonably capable of being regarded as reliable and a relevant person is satisfied that it is reliable.

    **31.** Article 16(6)(b) of the Money Laundering Order provides that written assurances may be provided each time that reliance is placed or through a more general arrangement with an obliged person that has an element of duration, e.g. terms of business.

    **32.** Article 16(7) of the Money Laundering Order states that a relevant person (including a person who was formerly a relevant person) who has given an assurance to another person under Article 16 (5) of the Money Laundering Order (or under an equivalent provision that applies outside Jersey) must, if requested by the other person, provide the person with the evidence obtained from applying the reliance identification measures.

    **33.** Article 16(11) of the Money Laundering Order states that nothing in this Article permits a relevant person to rely on the reliance identification measures of an obliged person if:

    - the relevant person suspects money laundering or the financing of terrorism;
    - the relevant person considers that there is a higher risk of money laundering on the basis of the assessment made under Article 16(3) of the Money Laundering Order;
    - the obliged person is a person having a relevant connection with an enhanced risk state (within the meaning of Article 15 of the Money Laundering Order).

    **34.** Notwithstanding that reliance may be placed on an obliged person, Article 16(10) of the Money Laundering Order states that a relevant person is liable for any failure to apply reliance identification measures.


!!! warning "AML/CFT/CPF Code of Practice"

    **35.** To the extent that reliance is placed on an obliged person, a supervised person must be able to demonstrate that the conditions required by the Money Laundering Order are met.

    **36.** All evidence of identity passed by the obliged person to a supervised person (on request) must be confirmed by the obliged person as being a true copy of either an original or copy document held on its file.


## Assurance in writing about reliance identification measures

**37.** A supervised person may demonstrate that it has obtained adequate assurance in writing from an obliged person under Article 16(4)(a) of the Money Laundering Order that it has applied reliance identification measures to the customer, where the obliged person:

- provides information on identity that it has found out using an information template; and
- explains what evidence of identity it has obtained.

**38.** An assurance that addresses the matters listed in paragraph 37 above will be reasonably capable of being regarded as reliable under Article 16(6)(a) of the Money Laundering Order.

**39.** As stated at Article 16(4)(b) of the Money Laundering Order and referenced in the statutory requirements section above, a supervised person must not rely on an obliged person who is in turn relying on someone else (also known as a chain of reliance). See the diagram below for a graphical explanation of this point.

## Acceptable reliance arrangement

**40.** Where, as a result of Article 16(6)(b) of the Money Laundering Order, a supervised person has a more general arrangement with an obliged person, such as terms of business, that more general arrangement may be used to explain what evidence of identity will routinely be obtained by the obliged person.

## Access to evidence of identity

**41.** A supervised person will have demonstrated that an obliged person is providing evidence of identity without delay if it is provided within two working days. If it is provided later than five working days, it is not provided without delay. If it is provided between two and five working days, the supervised person must be able to show why this constitutes provision without delay based on the nature of its customer base. In order to demonstrate that it has adequately assessed a delay, the supervised person is expected to provide detail of the reasons for the delay, how many days evidence remained outstanding, how many times a delay has occurred previously across the supervised person's practice, as well as the board / senior management's considerations.

#### 5.1.1 Assessment of risk

**42.** The risk factors that are set out in this section will also be relevant to a CRA that is conducted under section 3.3.4.1 of this Handbook, in the cases highlighted at sections 4.4 and 4.5 of this Handbook.

!!! danger "Statutory Requirement"

    **43.** Before relying upon the obliged person, the relevant person must assess the risk of doing so and make a written record of the reasons the relevant person considers that it is appropriate to do so, having regard to two risks.

    **44.** The first is the higher risk of money laundering or the financing of terrorism should an obliged person fail to carry out any actions specified in the assurances obtained under Articles 16(4) and (5) of the Money Laundering Order.

    **45.** The second is the risk that an obliged person will fail to provide the relevant person with evidence without delay if requested to do so by the relevant person.

    **46.** Article 16(3) of the Money Laundering Order requires a relevant person to prepare a written record of the reason why it is appropriate to place reliance on an obliged person.


!!! warning "AML/CFT/CPF Code of Practice"

    **47.** In a case where, for a particular business relationship, testing under Articles 16(8) and (9) of the Money Laundering Order highlights that an obliged person:

    - has not applied the necessary reliance identification measures;
    - does not provide adequate, accurate and current information;
    - does not keep evidence of identity for as long as is necessary; or
    - will not provide that evidence without delay when requested to do so;

    - a supervised person must review the basis upon which it has placed reliance on that obliged person for other relationships (if any) to determine whether it is still appropriate to do so.


!!! info "Guidance"

    **48.** Immediately before relying upon an obliged person, a supervised person may demonstrate that it has had regard for the higher risk of money laundering, the financing of terrorism, or the financing of proliferation, and risk that an obliged person will fail to provide the supervised person with evidence of identity without delay if requested to do so, where it considers the following factors:

    - the stature and regulatory track record of the obliged person;
    - the risks posed by the country/territory/area in which the obliged person is based. Factors to consider include those found at section 3.3.4.1 of this Handbook;
    - the adequacy of the framework to combat money laundering, the financing of terrorism, or the financing of proliferation in place in the country/territory/area in which the obliged person is based, and the period of time that the framework has been in place;
    - the adequacy of the supervisory regime to combat money laundering, the financing of terrorism, or the financing of proliferation to which the obliged person is subject;
    - the adequacy of identification measures applied by the obliged person to combat money laundering, the financing of terrorism, and the financing of proliferation.

    **49.** A supervised person may demonstrate that it has considered the adequacy of identification measures applied by an obliged person where it takes one or more of the following steps:

    - reviews previous experience (if any) with the obliged person, in particular the adequacy and accuracy of information on identity found out by the obliged person and whether that information is current;
    - makes specific enquiries, e.g., through use of a questionnaire or series of questions;

    - reviews relevant policies and procedures to combat money laundering, the financing of terrorism, and the financing of proliferation in place at the obliged person;
    - where the obliged person is a member of a financial group, makes enquiries concerning the extent to which group standards are applied to and assessed by the group's internal audit function.


### 5.2 Group reliance

**50.** In some strictly limited cases, a supervised person may meet its obligation to comply with Articles 13(1)(a) or (c)(ii) ( CDD ); 15(1)(a), (b), (d), (e) or (g) ( Enhanced CDD Measures ); or 15A ( Enhanced CDD Measures in relation to PEPs ) of the Money Laundering Order, and the AML/CFT/CPF Codes of Practice by placing reliance on similar identification measures that have already been applied by a party outside Jersey who is a member of the same financial group as the supervised person, but is not also an obliged person.

**51.** The effect of Article 16A of the Money Laundering Order is therefore to extend the application of Article 16 of the Money Laundering Order to an 'external person' who could not otherwise be relied on, and the six conditions and provisions for testing outlined in section 5.1 of this Handbook apply to an external person in the same way as to an obliged person.

**52.** Under the definitions provided in Article 16A(1) of the Money Laundering Order, in this s ection 'external person' means a person outside Jersey, who:

- is not an obliged person;
- is a member of the same financial group as the supervised person; and
- carries on a business which, if that business were carried on in Jersey, would be a supervised business.

!!! danger "Statutory Requirement"

    **53.** In some strictly limited circumstances, Article 16A of the Money Laundering Order provides that a relevant person may be considered to have applied similar identification measures specified in Article 3(2)(a), (aa), (b) and (c) of the Money Laundering Order where such measures have already been applied by an external person.

    **54.** Under Article 16A(2)(c-f) of the Money Laundering Order, in order to place reliance on an external person, the financial group to which the relevant person and external person belong must:

    - apply CDD measures and record-keeping requirements in line with the Money Laundering Order or in line with FATF Recommendations 10, 11 and 12;
    - maintain a programme against money laundering and the financing of terrorism which includes policies and procedures by which every member of the group who carries on a financial services business (or equivalent) shares information that is appropriate for the purpose of preventing and detecting money laundering and the financing of terrorism (an AML/CFT programme);
    - adequately mitigate any higher risk of money laundering and the financing of terrorism through its policies and procedures;

    - be supervised by an overseas regulatory authority in its implementation of CDD measures and record-keeping requirements, and its AML/CFT programme.

    **55.** Article 16(A)(2), (3), (4), (5) and (6) of the Money Laundering Order states that reliance is always subject to several conditions. These are outlined at paragraphs 21 to 26 above, where references to 'obliged person' should be read as referring to 'external person'.

    **56.** Articles 16(A)(7) and (8) of the Money Laundering Order state that reliance must always be subject to testing. Provisions in this respect are outlined at paragraphs 27 to 29 above, where references to 'obliged person' should be read as referring to 'external person'.

    **57.** Article 1(5) of the Money Laundering Order explains that a person is a member of the same financial group as another person if there is, in relation to the group, a parent company or other legal person that exercises control over every member of that group for the purposes of applying group supervision under:

    - the Core Principles for Effective Banking Supervision published by the Basel Committee;
    - the Objectives and Principles for Securities Regulation issued by IOSCO; or
    - the Insurance Supervisory Principles issued by the IAIS.


!!! warning "AML/CFT/CPF Code of Practice"

    **58.** A supervised person may not rely on an ' external person ' where it suspects money laundering, the financing of terrorism, or the financing of proliferation, considers that there is a higher risk of money laundering, the financing of terrorism or the financing of proliferation on the basis of a risk assessment carried out under Article 16(3) of the Money Laundering Order, or where the external person has a relevant connection to an enhanced risk state.

    **59.** Despite a supervised person's reliance on an 'external person' under Article 16A(9) of the Money Laundering Order, a supervised person is liable for any failure to apply similar identification measures.
