# Section 12 - Trust Company Business

## 12. TRUST AND COMPANY SERVICE PROVIDERS TCSPs)

**1.** This section applies to all supervised persons who are TCSPs as described in the Guideline s, including Trust Company Businesses.

**2.** The purpose of this section is to assist with the application of identification measures to a customer where a supervised person established a business relationship or carries out a one-off transaction in the course of carrying on Trust Company Businesses.

## 12.2. Identification measures

**3.** This section applies where a supervised person carries on a business under Article 2(3) of the FS(J) Law and, in the course of providing those services, the person provides any of the services specified in Article 2(4) of the FS(J) Law.

**4.** This section also applies where a supervised person carries on a business that is described in paragraph 23(1)(b)(i) of Part 3 of Schedule 2 to the [Proceeds of Crime Law](https://www.jerseylaw.je/laws/current/l_8_1999).

**5.** This section does not deal with the provision of any service to a ' COBO-only fund '. A COBOonly fund is a scheme that would be a collective investment fund (as defined in the CIF(J) Law ) except for the fact that the capital, the collective investment of which is the object or one of the objects of the scheme or arrangement, is not acquired by means of an offer to the public of units for subscription, sale, or exchange.

## 12.2.1. Obligation to apply identification measures

TCSPs

**6.** Among other things, Article 13 of the [Money Laundering Order](https://www.jerseylaw.je/laws/current/ro_20_2008) requires a supervised person to apply identification measures:

- before the establishment of a business relationship or before carrying out a one-off transaction; and
- in the course of a business relationship, where the supervised person has doubts about the adequacy of information previously obtained under identification measures.

**7.** A supervised person ( Person A ) that provides, acts as or fulfils one or more of the functions listed in Article 2(4) of the FS(J) Law, or arranges for another person ( Person B ) to do so (where Person B is an officer or Employee of Person A) will be considered to have established a business relationship under the Money Laundering Order.

**8.** Where Person B is not an officer or Employee of Person A, then Person A will not be considered to have established a business relationship each time that it arranges for another person to act as or fulfil such function. However, a supervised person will need to consider whether such an arrangement (a transaction) is a one-off transaction as defined in Article 4 of the Money Laundering Order.

**9.** A supervised person that acts only as a formation agent will not be considered to have established a business relationship with its customer. However, a supervised person will need to consider whether they provide the service of forming a legal arrangement or legal person as a business as defined in Schedule 2, Part 3, paragraph 23 of the Proceeds of Crime Law.

10. The requirement to apply identification measures also applies where the relationship that a supervised person has with its customer is conducted through another service provider, e.g., the supervised person provides a director to a client company that is administered by another person carrying on Trust Company Business.

## 12.2.2. Information for assessing risk -Stage 1.4

TCSPs

**11.** This section must be read in conjunction with and is supplemental to, [section 3.3.2](03-identification-overview.md#332-information-for-assessing-risk-stage-14) of this Handbook, which explains how a supervised person may demonstrate that it has obtained appropriate information for assessing the risk that a business relationship or one-off transaction will involve money laundering, the financing of terrorism, or the financing of proliferation.

## 12.2.2.1. Supervised person providing limited services

**12.** Where a supervised person provides only:

- registered office services; and/or
- secretarial services (defined in this section as limited services )

That supervised person is unlikely to have any oversight of, or control over, the activities of the legal arrangement or legal person in the way that it would if it also provided one or more directors (or equivalent) or provided full administration services. The absence of oversight or control increases the risk that a legal arrangement or legal person may be used for money laundering, the financing of terrorism, or the financing of proliferation.

**13.** The presence of this additional risk therefore requires a supervised person to request additional information on its customer, and on the activities of the legal arrangement or legal person to which it is to provide only limited services, for the purpose of countering money laundering, the financing of terrorism, and the financing of proliferation.

**14.** The risk that a legal arrangement or legal person may be used for money laundering, the financing of terrorism, or the financing of proliferation is likely to be mitigated where a customer to whom only limited services are provided is a body corporate, the securities of which are listed on an IOSCO compliant market or on a regulated market, or where a customer is a regulated person (or person who carries on equivalent business to any category of regulated business ).

    TCSPs

    **15.** In the case of a supervised person that provides only limited services to a legal arrangement or legal person, a supervised person may demonstrate that it has obtained appropriate information for assessing the risk that a business relationship or one-off transaction will involve money laundering, the financing of terrorism, or the financing of proliferation where it collects (at the time that a limited service is first provided and then on an ongoing basis thereafter) information on activities by reference to:

    - c opies of minutes of directors' and members' meetings that must be kept by a company (including, in the case of a PCC, copies of minutes of directors' and members' meetings of the cell company and each of its cells) under Part 15 of the Companies Law (or equivalent for other legal persons or legal arrangements); and
    - copies of accounts that must be prepared by the directors of a company (including, in the case of a PCC, copies of accounts that must be prepared by the directors of the cell

    company and each of its cells) under Part 16 of the Companies Law (or equivalent for other legal persons or legal arrangements); or

    - where accounts are not required to be prepared, underlying financial records that are maintained by the directors of that company (or equivalent for other legal persons or legal arrangements).


## 12.2.2.2. Co-trustees and additional general partners

**16.** In some cases, an express trust or limited partnership may have more than one trustee or general partner respectively. In such cases, it will be necessary for a supervised person that is to act as trustee or general partner to obtain information on each co-trustee or additional general partner (or limited partner that participates in the management of the limited partnership) to fully consider money laundering, financing of terrorism, and financing of proliferation risk.

!!! info "Guidance"

    TCSPs

    **17.** A supervised person that is to act as a trustee of an express trust may demonstrate that it has obtained appropriate information for assessing the risk that a business relationship or one-off transaction will involve money laundering, the financing of terrorism, or the financing of proliferation where it collects information on any co-trustees of the trust.

    **18.** A supervised person that is to act as a general partner of a limited partnership may demonstrate that it has obtained appropriate information for assessing the risk that a business relationship or one-off transaction will involve money laundering, the financing of terrorism, or the financing of proliferation where it collects information on any additional general partners or limited partners that participate in the management of the limited partnership.

    **19.** The information requested may include why it is necessary to have more than one trustee or general partner, and the stature and regulatory track-record of the co-trustee or additional general partner.


## 12.2.3. Assessment of risk -Stage 2.1

TCSPs

**20.** This section must be read in conjunction with and is supplemental to [section 3.3.4](03-identification-overview.md#334-assessment-of-risk-stage-21) of this Handbook, which sets out several factors that are to be taken into account by a supervised person when assessing the risk that a business relationship or one-off transaction will involve money laundering, the financing of terrorism, or the financing of proliferation.

!!! info "Guidance"

    **21.** A supervised person that is a TCSP may demonstrate that it has assessed the risk that a business relationship or one-off transaction will involve money laundering, the financing of terrorism, or the financing of proliferation where it considers the following additional risk factors:

    - any failure on the part of a customer to be open about the source of funds. In the case of a trust, this could indicate that, for example, a settlor is in fact a 'dummy' settl or who is using another's funds and not their own;

    - any failure to be open about the purpose and intended nature of the business relationship or one-off transaction. In the case of a trust, this could indicate that, for example, a settlor is withholding information on the persons who are actually intended to benefit from the trust, e.g., a settlor only nominates charities as beneficiaries of a trust, but they do not intend that the charity will in fact bene fit (known as a 'blind' trust);
    - any request to include unusual or non-standard clauses in a trust instrument or other constitutional document that might indicate that the disclosed purpose of the structure is not genuine;
    - any request for unusually close supervision or control of assets by a person other than the supervised person.


## 12.2.4. Identification measures: Finding out identity and obtaining evidence

TCSPs

**22.** The meaning of identification measures within this Handbook is set out in the Glossary of this Handbook. Identification measures include determining who the customer is.

**23.** Where a supervised person is to act as the trustee of an express trust, customers will include the settlor, protector (if any), beneficiaries with a vested right and any other beneficiaries and persons who are the object of a power and that have been identified as presenting a higher risk (see section 12.2.4.1 of this Handbook ).

**24.** Where a supervised person is to act as the general partner of a limited partnership, customers will include the limited partners of the partnership (see section 12.2.4.4 of this Handbook ).

**25.** Where a supervised person is to provide a non-management service, such as registered office, in respect of a limited partnership, the customer will be the general partner acting for the limited partnership -a third party (see [section 4.4.3](04-identification-measures.md#443-finding-out-identity-legal-arrangement-that-is-a-limited-partnership) of this Handbook ).

**26.** Where a supervised person is to provide a service to a company, the customer will be the company (see [section 4.5.1](04-identification-measures.md#451-finding-out-identity-legal-person-that-is-a-company) of this Handbook ).

**27.** Where a supervised person is to provide a service to a foundation, the customer will be the foundation (see [section 4.5.3](04-identification-measures.md#453-finding-out-identity-legal-person-that-is-a-foundation) of this Handbook ).

**28.** Where a supervised person is to provide a service to a separate limited partnership, incorporated limited partnership or limited liability partnership, the customer will be the partnership (see [Section 4.5.5](04-identification-measures.md#455-finding-out-identity-legal-person-that-is-a-partnership) of this Handbook ).

**29.** Where a supervised person is to form a company, partnership or foundation, the customer will be the persons who are the Beneficial owners and/or controllers of the legal person (see sections 4.3.1 and 4.5 of this Handbook ).

## 12.2.4.1. Finding out identity -Legal arrangement that is a trust

!!! info "Guidance"

    TCSPs

    **30.** A supervised person that is to act as the trustee of an express trust may demonstrate that it has applied identification measures under Article 3(2)(a) of the Money Laundering Order to its customer, where it applies those measures to:

    - the settlor, including any person subsequently settling funds into the trust (except if deceased) and any person who directly or indirectly provides trust property or makes a testamentary disposition on trust or to the trust;
    - any co-trustee;
    - any protector;
    - any beneficiary with a vested right;
    - any other beneficiary or person who is the object of a power and that has been identified as presenting a higher risk; and
    - any other person exercising ultimate effective control over the trust.

    **31.** In any case where a settlor, protector, beneficiary, object of a power or other person referred to in paragraph 30 (the person ) is not an individual, a supervised person may demonstrate that it has identified each individual who is the person's Beneficial owner and/or controller under Article 3(2)(c)(iii) of the Money Laundering Order where it has identified:

    - each individual with a material controlling ownership interest in the capital of the person (through direct or indirect holdings of interests or voting rights) or who exerts control through other ownership means;
    - to the extent that there is doubt as to whether the individuals exercising control through ownership are Beneficial owners, or where no individual exerts control through ownership, any other individual exercising control of the person through other means;
    - where no individual is otherwise identified under this section, individuals who exercise control of the person through positions held (e.g., those who have and exercise strategic decision-taking powers or have and exercise executive control through senior management positions).

    **32.** For lower risk relationships, a general threshold of 25% is considered to indicate a material controlling ownership interest in the capital of the person. Where the distribution of interests is uneven, the percentage where effective control may be exercised (a material interest) may be less than 25% when the distribution of other interests is considered, i.e., interests of less than 25% may be material interests.


## 12.2.4.2. Finding out identity -Legal arrangement that is a charitable trust (capital markets)

!!! info "Guidance"

    TCSPs

    **33.** A supervised person that is to act as the trustee of a charitable trust which is established to hold an investment in a security-issuing vehicle, or to hold security (as bare trustee for securityholders) over assets held within such a vehicle, may demonstrate that it has applied identification measures under Article 3(2)(a) of the Money Laundering Order to its customer, where it applies those measures to:

    - the originator or instigator of the capital market transaction;
    - each security-holder that can exercise effective control over the underlying security-issuing vehicle.


## 12.2.4.3. Obtaining evidence of identity -Legal arrangement that is a trust

**34.** The measures that must be applied to obtain evidence of identity of beneficiaries and persons who are the object of a power and that have been identified as presenting higher risk will reflect the verification methods that are available at a particular time to the trustee. For example, it may not be appropriate to request evidence directly from the beneficiary or object of a power.

**35.** Where a supervised person is not familiar with a document obtained as evidence of identity, additional appropriate measures may be necessary to satisfy itself that the evidence is genuine.

    TCSPs

    **36.** All key documents (or parts thereof) obtained as evidence of identity must be in a language understood by the employees of the business and must be translated into English at the request of the FIU or of the JFSC.


## 12.2.4.4. Finding out identity -Legal arrangement that is a limited partnership

!!! info "Guidance"

    TCSPs

    **37.** A supervised person that is to act as the general partner of a limited partnership may demonstrate that it has applied identification measures under Article 3(2)(a) of the Money Laundering Order to its customer where it applies those measures to limited partners holding a material controlling ownership interest in the capital of the partnership (through holdings of interests or voting rights) or any other person exercising control through other ownership means, e.g. partnership agreements, power to appoint senior management, or any outstanding debt that is convertible into voting rights.

    **38.** To the extent that there is doubt as to whether the persons exercising control through ownership are Beneficial owners, or where no person exerts control through ownership, a supervised person that is to act as the general partner of a limited partnership may demonstrate that it has applied identification measures under Article 3(2)(a) of the Money Laundering Order to its customer where it applies those measures to any other person exercising control over the partnership through other means, e.g., those who exert control through personal connections, by participating in financing, because of close family relationships, historical or contractual associations or as a result of default on certain payments.

    **39.** Where no person is identified under this section, a supervised person that is to act as the general partner of a limited partnership may demonstrate that it has applied identification measures under Article 3(2)(a) of the Money Laundering Order to its customer where it applies those measures to persons who exercise control through positions held (e.g. those who have or exercise strategic decision-taking powers or have or exercise executive control through senior management positions, e.g. general partner or limited partner that participates in management).

    **40.** In any case where a partner or other person is not an individual, a supervised person may demonstrate that it has identified each individual who is that person's Beneficial owner and/ or controller under Article 3(2)(c)(iii) of the Money Laundering Order where it has identified:

    - each individual with a material controlling ownership interest in the capital of the partnership (through direct or indirect holdings of interests or voting rights) or who exerts control through other ownership means;
    - to the extent that there is doubt as to whether the individuals exercising control through ownership are beneficial owners, or where no individual exerts control through ownership, any other individual exercising control over the partnership through other means;

    - where no individual is otherwise identified under this section, individuals who exercise control of the partnership through positions held (e.g., those who have and exercise strategic decision-taking powers or have or exercise executive control through senior management positions ).

    **41.** For lower risk relationships, a general threshold of 25% is considered to indicate a material controlling ownership interest in the capital of a limited partnership. Where the distribution of interests is uneven, the percentage where effective control may be exercised (a material interest) may be less than 25% when the distribution of other interests is considered, i.e., interests of less than 25% may be material interests.


## 12.2.4.5. Obtaining evidence of identity -Legal arrangement that is a limited partnership

**42.** Where a supervised person is not familiar with a document obtained as evidence of identity, additional appropriate measures may be necessary to satisfy itself that the evidence is genuine.

!!! warning "AML/CFT/CPF Code of Practice"

    TCSPs

    **43.** All key documents (or parts thereof) obtained as evidence of identity must be in a language understood by the employees of the business and must be translated into English at the request of the FIU or of the JFSC.


## 12.2.4.6. Finding out identity -Legal person that is a PCC

**44.** This section must be read in conjunction with and is supplemental to sections 4.5.1 and 4.5.2 of this Handbook.

**45.** Under Article 127YDA(1) of the Companies Law, in the case of both PCCs and ICCs, a cell shall have the same registered office and secretary as the cell company. The registered office must also be in Jersey.

**46.** As a result, where a supervised person provides a registered office or secretary to a PCC, it will do so for each cell of that PCC as well. Because the cell of a PCC does not have the ability to enter into arrangements or contract in its own name, for the purposes of Article 3 of the Money Laundering Order, the PCC will be taken to be a customer acting for a third party and each cell will be taken to be a third party that is a person other than an individual. Identification measures must therefore be applied under Article 13 of the Money Laundering Order to the PCC (the customer ) and each cell of the PCC (a third party).

## 12.2.5. Timing of identification measures

**47.** This section must be read in conjunction with and is supplemental to sections 4.1 and 4.7 of this Handbook.

**48.** In line with Article 13(8) of the Money Laundering Order, a supervised person that is to act as a trustee may delay obtaining evidence of the identity of a customer after the time that a business relationship is established so long as:

- it obtains evidence of identity at the time of, or before, distribution of trust property or income; and
- it is satisfied that there is little risk of money laundering, the financing of terrorism, or the financing of proliferation occurring because of obtaining evidence after entitlement is conferred.

**49.** Similar provisions should apply in a case where the customer of the supervised person changes during the course of a business relationship.

!!! info "Guidance"

    **50.** During a business relationship, a supervised person that is the trustee of an express trust may demonstrate that it has obtained evidence that is reasonably capable of verifying the identity of each beneficiary with a vested right where:

    - it obtains evidence of identity at the time of, or before, distribution of trust property or income; and
    - it is satisfied that there is little risk of money laundering, the financing of terrorism, or the financing of proliferation occurring because of obtaining evidence after entitlement is conferred.

    **51.** During the course of a business relationship, a supervised person that is the trustee of an express trust may demonstrate that it has obtained evidence that is reasonably capable of verifying the identity of a beneficiary or person who is the object of a trust power, where it does so at the time that the person is identified as presenting a higher risk.


## 12.2.6. Failure to complete identification measures

TCSPs

**52.** This section must be read in conjunction with and is supplemental to [section 4.8](04-identification-measures.md#48-failure-to-complete-identification-measures) of this Handbook.

**53.** Under Article 14 of the Money Laundering Order, if a supervised person is unable to apply identification measures when required to do so, then it must terminate that business relationship or not carry out that one-off transaction and consider whether to make a SAR to the FIU.

**54.** This requirement may cause conflicts where a supervised person is acting as a trustee, its customer is the beneficiary or object of a power of a trust and:

- the relationship between a supervised person and its customer is governed by other legislation, e.g., the Trusts (Jersey) Law 1984; and
- the termination of a relationship with a customer (a beneficiary or object of a power) may have a prejudicial effect on the interests of other customers.

**55.** This requirement may also cause conflicts where a supervised person is acting as a council member, its customer is a foundation, and the foundation is governed by the Foundations Law. Under Article 12(3) of the Foundations Law the retirement or removal of the qualified member of a foundation does not take effect until immediately before the appointment of a new qualified person to be the qualified member of the council has taken effect.

**56.** In order to address such potential issues, termination of a business relationship may be delayed until such time as compliance with Article 14 of the Money Laundering Order does not conflict with another legal requirement, and/or does not have any prejudicial effect on the interests of other customers, so long as the risk of money laundering, the financing of terrorism, or the financing of proliferation is effectively managed.

## 12.2.7. Provision of information by trustees

TCSPs

!!! danger "Statutory Requirement"

    **57.** Article 2 of the Information Order requires a person who is acting as a trustee of a trust to state that that person is acting in their capacity as trustee of that trust (and not in that person's personal capacity) when:

    - forming a business relationship with a relevant business; or
    - conducting a one-off transaction with a relevant business.

    **58.** Article 3(1) of the Information Order states that despite any provision of any trust document, or any other enactment, the trustee of a trust:

    - must provide to a competent authority any information requested by that competent authority; and
    - may provide to a relevant business with which the trust has a business relationship, on request by that business, information regarding:
    - the beneficial ownership of the trust;
    - the settlor, protector or enforcer of the trust, if any; or
    - the assets of the trust that are to be held or managed by the relevant business under the terms of the business relationship.

    **59.** Article 3(2) of the Information Order states that a request for information by an external competent authority must be made via a competent authority under an appropriate international cooperation request.

    **60.** Article 3(3) of the Information Order states that on receipt of a request for information from an external competent authority under paragraph (2), a competent authority may request all or any of that information from the trust.
