# Section 9 - Screening, Awareness and Training

**1.** One of the most important controls over the prevention and detection of money laundering, the financing of terrorism and the financing of proliferation is to have appropriately screened employees who are:

- alert to money laundering, terrorist financing, and proliferation financing risks; and
- well trained in the recognition of notable transactions or activity which may indicate money laundering, the financing of terrorism, or the financing of proliferation activity (see [section 6](06-ongoing-monitoring.md) of this Handbook ).

**2.** The effective application of even the best designed systems and controls (including policies and procedures ) is compromised if Employees lack competence or integrity, or are unaware of, or fail to apply, systems and controls (including policies and procedures ), or if Employees are not adequately trained.

**3.** It is essential that a supervised person takes action to make sure that customer -facing and other Employees are:

- competent and have integrity;
- aware of policies and procedures and their obligations under the Anti-Money laundering and Counter-Terrorism Legislation and the AML/CFT/CPF Codes of Practice issued under the [Supervisory Bodies Law](https://www.jerseylaw.je/laws/current/Pages/08.785.30.aspx);
- trained in the recognition of notable transactions or activities (which may indicate money laundering, the financing of terrorism, or the financing of proliferation ) or transactions and activity with enhanced risk states and/or sanctioned persons.

**4.** In particular, customer -facing Employees and those who handle, or are responsible for the handling of, customers and transactions will provide a supervised person with its strongest defence, or its weakest link.

**5.** As noted in the Glossary of this Handbook, for the purposes of this Handbook the term ' Employee ' should be understood to include officers of a supervised person and is not limited to individuals working under a contract of employment. It will include temporary and contract Employees, and the Employee of any external party fulfilling a function in relation to a supervised person under an outsourcing agreement or Employee of an AMLSP providing AMLSP services to the supervised person under an AMLSP agreement. For the purposes of this section, employees also include any agents acting as part of an MVTS ' network, whereby an MVTS should treat employees of any agents as their own.

**6.** A supervised person should also encourage its Employees to maintain an active awareness of the risks of money laundering, the financing of terrorism, and the financing of proliferation as they carry out their duties.

### 9.2 Screening of Employees

!!! danger "Statutory Requirement"

    **7.** Article 11(1)(d) of the [Money Laundering Order](https://www.jerseylaw.je/laws/current/ro_20_2008) requires a relevant person to maintain appropriate and consistent policies and procedures relating to screening of employees.


!!! warning "AML/CFT/CPF Code of Practice"

    **8.** A supervised person must screen the competence and probity of the following Employees at the time of recruitment and where there is a subsequent change in an E mployee's role:

    - customer -facing Employees and other Employees handling, or being responsible for the handling of, business relationships or one-off transactions;
    - Employees directly supporting customer -facing Employees or other Employees handling or responsible for the handling of business relationships or one-off transactions, e.g., individuals processing and book-keeping customer transactions;
    - the MLRO (and any Deputy MLRO ) and MLCO; and
    - the board and senior management.


!!! info "Guidance"

    **9.** With reference to the AML/CFT/CPF Codes of Practice at paragraph 8 above, a supervised person may demonstrate that an Employee is screened where it does one or more of the following, as appropriate for the nature of the E mployee's role and responsibilities:

    - obtains and confirms references provided;
    - obtains and confirms employment history and qualifications disclosed;
    - obtains details of any regulatory action taken against the individual (or absence of such action);
    - obtains and confirms details of any criminal convictions (or absence of such convictions).

    **10.** Enquiries into an individual's criminal past are required to be subject to the Rehabilitation of Offenders (Jersey) Law 2001, which prevents a supervised person requesting information from its directors, senior managers and other Employees (and prospective directors, senior managers and other Employees ) about convictions that are "spent", except where provided for by the Rehabilitation of Offenders (Exceptions) (Jersey) Regulations 2002.


### 9.3 Obligations to promote awareness and to train

Overview

**11.** The Money Laundering Order requirements concerning both the promotion of awareness and the provision of training apply to Employees whose duties relate to the provision of a supervised business (defined in the Glossary of this Handbook as ' relevant employees '). They do not apply to all Employees of a supervised person. However, money laundering, the financing of terrorism, or the financing of proliferation offences established in the [Proceeds of Crime Law](https://www.jerseylaw.je/laws/current/l_8_1999), Terrorism Law and other legislation are wider in scope, therefore all Employees will need to have a basic understanding of money laundering, the financing of terrorism, or the financing of proliferation and how they may manifest themselves. All Employees must also know and apply internal reporting procedures and know the identity of the MLRO (and, if applicable, the Deputy MLRO ) and know how to contact them.

**12.** Relevant employees will include, among others, relationship managers, accounting and bookkeeping staff, and stockbrokers.

!!! danger "Statutory Requirement"

    **13.** Articles 11(9), (10), (10A), (11) and (12) of the Money Laundering Order require that a relevant person must, in relation to employees whose duties relate to the provision of a financial services business:

    - take appropriate measures from time to time for the purposes of making them aware of:
    - the CDD, record-keeping, reporting and other policies and procedures for the purposes of preventing and detecting money laundering and the financing of terrorism;
    - the enactments in Jersey relating to money laundering and the financing of terrorism and any relevant Code of Practice.
    - provide those employees from time-to-time with training in the recognition and handling of:
    - transactions carried out by or on behalf of any person who is or appears to be engaged in money laundering or the financing of terrorism;
    - other conduct that indicates that a person is or appears to be engaged in money laundering or the financing of terrorism.

    Such training to include the provision of information on current money laundering techniques, methods and trends and on the financing of terrorism;

    - establish and maintain procedures that monitor and test the effectiveness of the relevant person's policies and procedures, employees' awareness and the training provided to employees, such testing having regard to the risk of money laundering that exist in respect of the relevant person's business and matters that may have an impact on that risk (e.g. size, nature and structure).


!!! warning "AML/CFT/CPF Code of Practice"

    **14.** A supervised person must:

    - provide Employees who are not relevant employees with a written explanation of the supervised person's and employees' obligations and potential criminal liability under the Anti-Money laundering and Counter-Terrorism Legislation, including the implications of failing to make an internal SAR;
    - require such Employees to acknowledge that they understand the supervised person's written explanation and its procedures for making internal SARs.

    **15.** In the case of a supervised person who is a sole trader, that person must be aware of the enactments in Jersey relating to money laundering, the financing of terrorism, or the financing of proliferation and the AML/CFT/CPF Codes of Practice.

    **16.** In the case of a supervised person who is a sole trader, that person must be able to recognise and be aware of their obligations surrounding:

    - transactions carried out by, or on behalf of, a person who is, or appears to be, engaged in money laundering, the financing of terrorism, or the financing of proliferation;
    - other conduct that indicates a person is, or appears to be, engaged in money laundering, the financing of terrorism, or the financing of proliferation.


!!! info "Guidance"

    **17.** A supervised person may demonstrate that it has satisfied awareness raising and training obligations that apply to relevant employees where it includes:

    - customer -facing Employees and other Employees handling, or being responsible for the handling of, business relationships or one-off transactions;
    - Employees directly supporting customer -facing Employees or other Employees handling, or being responsible for the handling of, business relationships or one-off transactions, e.g., individuals processing, book-keeping and accounting for customer transactions
    - the MLRO (and any Deputy MLRO ) and MLCO;
    - the board and senior management.

    **18.** A supervised person who is a sole trader may demonstrate that they are aware of relevant enactments and are able to recognise and are aware of their obligations surrounding transactions and other conduct (under paragraph 16 above) where they have received formal training or through self-study.


### 9.4 Awareness of relevant employees

**19.** With the passage of time between training initiatives, the level of Employee awareness of the risk of money laundering, the financing of terrorism, or the financing of proliferation decreases. The utilisation of techniques to maintain a high level of awareness can greatly enhance the effectiveness of a supervised person's defences against money laundering, financing of terrorism, or financing of proliferation risk.

!!! info "Guidance"

    **20.** A supervised person may demonstrate that it has appropriate awareness measures in place to make relevant employees aware of policies and procedures where it:

    - provides them with a written explanation of its BRA, in order to provide context for those policies and procedures;
    - provides them with case studies illustrating how products or services provided by the supervised person may be abused, in order to provide context for the application of policies and procedures;

    - provides ready access to its policies and procedures.

    **21.** A supervised person may demonstrate that it takes appropriate measures to make relevant employees aware of enactments in Jersey relating to money laundering, the financing of terrorism, or the financing of proliferation where it:

    - provides relevant employees with a written explanation of the supervised person's and E mployee's obligations and potential criminal liability under the Proceeds of Crime Law, Terrorism Law, Directions Law, and the Targeted Financial Sanctions Measures, including the implications of failing to make an internal SAR;
    - provides relevant employees with a written explanation of the disciplinary measures that may be applied for failing to report knowledge, suspicion, or reasonable grounds for knowledge or suspicion, without reasonable excuse, or as soon as practicable;
    - requires such employees to acknowledge that they understand the supervised person's written explanations and procedures for making internal SARs;
    - reminds Employees of their obligations from time-to-time and the need to remain vigilant;
    - circulates relevant material, e.g., material that is published by the JFSC or FIU, FATF, or EU, in order to provide context for enactments in Jersey;
    - circulates relevant media reports, to provide context for enactments in Jersey.

    **22.** A supervised person may demonstrate that it takes appropriate measures to make relevant employees who are officers (e.g., directors and equivalent) aware of enactments in Jersey relating to money laundering, the financing of terrorism, or the financing of proliferation, where the supervised person also explains how officers may be held personally liable for an offence committed by the supervised person.


#### 9.4.1 Monitoring and testing effectiveness

!!! info "Guidance"

    **23.** A supervised person may demonstrate that it maintains procedures for monitoring and testing the effectiveness of awareness-raising where it periodically tests E mployees' awareness of:

    - risks and policies and procedures; and
    - statutory obligations;

    and takes appropriate action where awareness is insufficient.

    **24.** An MVTS supervised person may demonstrate the provision of training to or by agents as part of that MVTS 's network by conducting audits of the training delivered and being provided with assurances by that agent that any training delivered within the relevant period is appropriate and in conjunction with the requirements of this Handbook.


#### 9.4.2 Technological developments

!!! warning "AML/CFT/CPF Code of Practice"

    **25.** Where a supervised person has identified a risk that may arise in relation to new products, services, business practices or technology, including where developed at group level or by outside developers (in Jersey and elsewhere), a supervised person must take steps to ensure that those involved in their development have a basic awareness of money laundering, the financing of terrorism, or the financing of proliferation, and of current money laundering techniques, methods and trends.


!!! info "Guidance"

    **26.** A supervised person may demonstrate that developers have a basic awareness of money laundering, the financing of terrorism, or the financing of proliferation, and of current techniques, methods and trends where it:

    - provides them with a written explanation of its BRA, in order to provide context for development work;
    - provides case studies illustrating how new products, services, business practices and technology may be abused;
    - circulates any relevant material, e.g., material that is published by the JFSC or FIU, the FATF, or the EU; and
    - circulates relevant media reports.

    **27.** A supervised person may also demonstrate that developers have a basic awareness of money laundering, the financing of terrorism, or the financing of proliferation and of current techniques, methods and trends, where it obtains assurances that similar measures to those set out in paragraph 26 are taken by group or outside developers.


### 9.5 Training of Employees

**28.** The guiding principle for all AML/CFT/CPF training should be to encourage Employees, irrespective of their level of seniority, to understand and accept their responsibility to contribute to the protection of the supervised person against the threat of money laundering, the financing of terrorism, or the financing of proliferation.

**29.** There can be a risk that more junior Employees, noncustomer facing Employees and support Employees consider that their role is less crucial than, or secondary to, that of more senior or customer -facing colleagues. This can lead to failures to report important information because of assumptions that the information will have already been identified and dealt with by other colleagues. A supervised person should be aware of this risk and take steps to address it through the training provided.

!!! warning "AML/CFT/CPF Code of Practice"

    **30.** A supervised person must provide Employees with adequate training at appropriate frequencies. Such training must:

    - be tailored to the supervised person and be relevant to the Employees to whom it is delivered;
    - highlight to Employees the importance of the contribution that they can individually make to the prevention and detection of money laundering, the countering of terrorist financing, and the countering of proliferation financing;
    - cover key aspects of legislation to prevent and detect money laundering, to counter terrorist financing, and to counter proliferation financing.


#### 9.5.1 All relevant employees

!!! info "Guidance"

    **31.** A supervised person may demonstrate the provision of adequate training to relevant employees where it addresses:

    - the supervised person and employees' obligations under the Proceeds of Crime Law, Terrorism Law, Directions Law, the Targeted Financial Sanctions Measures, Money Laundering Order and AML/CFT/CPF Codes of Practice issued under the Supervisory Bodies Law;
    - vulnerabilities of products and services offered by the supervised person (based on the supervised person's BRA ), and subsequent money laundering, terrorist financing, or proliferation financing risk;
    - policies and procedures, and E mployees' responsibilities under the same;
    - application of risk-based CDD policies and procedures;
    - recognition and examination of notable transactions and activity, such as activity outside of expected patterns, unusual settlements, abnormal payment or delivery instructions and changes in the patterns of business relationships;
    - money laundering, financing of terrorism, or proliferation financing developments, including techniques, methods, trends and typologies (having regard for reports published by relevant Jersey authorities, FATF and FSRBs);
    - management of business relationships or one-off transactions subject to an internal SAR, e.g., risk of committing the offence of tipping off, and dealing with questions from such customers, and/or their advisers.

    - conducting and recording a BRA;
    - establishing a formal strategy to counter money laundering, the financing of terrorism, or the financing of proliferation; and

    - assessing the effectiveness of, and compliance with, systems and controls (including policies and procedures ).


#### 9.5.3 The MLCO

!!! info "Guidance"

    **33.** A supervised person may demonstrate the provision of adequate training to the MLCO where, in addition to training for relevant employees, it addresses the monitoring and testing of compliance with systems and controls (including policies and procedures ) in place to counter money laundering, the financing of terrorism, or the financing of proliferation.


#### 9.5.4 The MLRO and Deputy MLRO(s)

!!! info "Guidance"

    **34.** A supervised person may demonstrate the provision of adequate training to the MLRO (and, if applicable, Deputy MLROs ) where, in addition to training for relevant employees, it addresses:

    - the handling and validation of internal SARs;
    - liaising with the JFSC, FIU and law enforcement;
    - management of the risk of tipping off; and
    - the handling of production and restraint orders.


#### 9.5.5 Nonrelevant employees

!!! info "Guidance"

    **35.** A supervised person may demonstrate the provision of adequate training to Employees who are not relevant employees where it addresses:

    - the threat of money laundering, the financing of terrorism, or the financing of proliferation; and
    - procedures for making internal SARs.


#### 9.5.6 Timing and frequency of training

!!! info "Guidance"

    **36.** A supervised person may demonstrate the provision of training at appropriate frequencies

    by:

    - providing all Employees with induction training within 10 working days of the commencement of employment and, when necessary, where there is a subsequent change in an employee's role; and
    - delivering training to all Employees at least once every two years, and otherwise determining the frequency of training for relevant employees based on risk, with more frequent training delivered where appropriate.


#### 9.5.7 Monitoring the effectiveness of screening, awareness, and training

**37.** Monitoring and testing the effectiveness of policies and procedures, awareness-raising measures and of training provided is a function of the MLCO, further detail of which is set out at [Section 2.6](02-corporate-governance.md#26-the-mlco) of this Handbook.
