# Section 10 - Record Keeping

**1.** This section outlines the statutory provisions concerning record-keeping for the purposes of countering money laundering, the financing of terrorism or proliferation financing. It also sets AML/CFT/CPF Codes of Practice and provides Guidance notes on the keeping of records. More general obligations on supervised persons to maintain records in relation to their business are not addressed in this section -these may extend the period for which records must be kept.

**2.** Record-keeping is essential to facilitate effective investigation, prosecution, and confiscation of criminal property. If law enforcement agencies, either in Jersey or elsewhere, are unable to trace criminal property due to inadequate record-keeping, then prosecution for money laundering, the financing of terrorism, or the financing of proliferation and confiscation of criminal property may not be possible. Likewise, if the funds used to finance terrorist activity or proliferation activity cannot be traced back through the financial system, then the sources and the destination of terrorist financing or proliferation financing will not be identified.

**3.** Record-keeping is also essential to facilitate effective supervision, allowing the JFSC to supervise compliance by supervised persons with statutory requirements and AML/CFT/CPF Codes of Practice. Records provide evidence of the work that a supervised person has undertaken to comply with these requirements. Records also provide a necessary context for the opinion that may be prepared on the truth and fairness of a supervised person's financial statements by its external auditor.

**4.** Records may be kept:

- by way of original documents;
- by way of copies of original documents (certified where appropriate);
- in scanned form; or
- in computerised or electronic form.

### 10.2 Recording evidence of identity and other CDD measures

**5.** In relation to evidence of a customer's identity, a supervised person is required to keep a copy of, or references to, the evidence of the customer's identity obtained during the application of CDD measures.

**6.** In addition, a supervised person is required to keep supporting documents, data, and information in respect of a business relationship or one-off transaction. This consists of:

- accounts files;
- business correspondence records; and
- the results of any analysis undertaken regarding the business relationship or any transaction.

    - all the supporting documents, data, and information in respect of a business relationship or one-off transaction which is the subject of CDD measures, including the results of analysis undertaken in relation to the business relationship or any transaction.

    **9.** Article 19(4) of the Money Laundering Order requires a relevant person to keep records in such a manner that they can be made available swiftly to the JFSC, police officer or customs officer for the purpose of complying with a requirement under any enactment, e.g. a production order under Article 40 of the [Proceeds of Crime Law](https://www.jerseylaw.je/laws/current/l_8_1999).

    **10.** Articles 20(1) and 20(2) of the Money Laundering Order require a relevant person to keep records for at least five years from:
    - (i) the end of the business relationship with the customer; or
    - (ii) the completion of the one-off transaction.
    **11.** Article 20(5) of the Money Laundering Order allows the JFSC to require a relevant person to keep records for a period longer than five years.

    **13.** Examples of business correspondence may include, but are not limited to:

    - e-mails;
    - letters;

    **14.** A supervised person should consider, on a case-by-case basis, whether any records additional to those required under the Money Laundering Order or the AML/CFT/CPF Codes of Practice set out above should be kept for a particular business relationship or one-off transaction.


### 10.3 Recording transactions

**15.** Details of all transactions carried out by a supervised person with or for a customer in the course of carrying on a supervised business must be recorded. Additional records in support of such transactions, in whatever form they are used, e.g., credit/debit slips, cheques, will also be kept.

!!! danger "Statutory Requirement"

    **16.** Article 19(2)(b) of the Money Laundering Order requires a relevant person to keep a record containing details of every transaction carried out with or for the customer in the course of a financial services business. In every case, sufficient information must be recorded to enable the reconstruction of individual transactions.

    **17.** Article 19(4) of the Money Laundering Order requires a relevant person to keep records in such a manner that they can be made available swiftly to the JFSC, police officer or customs officer for the purpose of complying with a requirement under any enactment, e.g., a production order under Article 40 of the Proceeds of Crime Law.

    **20.** A record must be kept of the following for every transaction carried out in the course of a business relationship or one-off transaction:

    - the name and address of the customer;
    - if a monetary transaction, the kind of currency and the amount;
    - if the transaction involves a customer's account, the number, name or other identifier for the account;
    - the date of the transaction;
    - details of the counterparty, including account details;
    - the nature of the transaction; and
    - details of the transaction.

    **21.** Customer transaction records must provide a clear and complete transaction history of incoming and outgoing funds or assets.


!!! info "Guidance"

    **22.** A supervised person may demonstrate that it has kept details of a transaction where it records:

    - valuation(s) and price(s);

    - the form in which funds are transferred (e.g., cash, cheque, electronic transfer)
    - memoranda of instruction(s) and authority(ies);
    - memoranda of purchase and sale;
    - custody of title documentation.

    **23.** A supervised person may demonstrate that it has a clear and complete transaction history where it records all transactions undertaken on behalf of a customer within that customer's records. For example, a customer's records should include all requests for wire transfer transactions where settlement is provided other than from funds drawn from a customer's account with the supervised person.

    **24.** When original vouchers or documents are used for account entry, e.g., credit/debit slips and cheques, and not returned to the customer, a supervised person may demonstrate that it has kept details of a transaction where such vouchers or documents are kept for at least one year to assist forensic analysis.


### 10.4 Other recording-keeping requirements

    **28.** A supervised person must keep a record of what barriers (including cultural barriers) exist to prevent the operation of effective systems and controls (including policies and procedures ) in line with [section 2.3](02-corporate-governance.md#23-board-responsibilities) of this Handbook for a period of five years after the end of the calendar year in which a matter is considered.

    **29.** A supervised person must keep adequate and orderly records to demonstrate the MLRO (and Deputy MLRO ) and MLCO 's experience and skills, independence, access to resources and technical awareness, in line with sections 2.6 and 2.7 of this Handbook for a period of five years after the end of the calendar year in which an individual ceases to act in said positions.

!!! warning "AML/CFT/CPF Code of Practice"

    **31.** Where a supervised person is required to apply an identification measure through an AML/CFT/CPF Codes of Practice set in sections 4, 5 and 7 of this Handbook, an adequate and orderly record of that measure must be kept in line with the record-keeping requirements set out in Part 4 of the Money Laundering Order.

    **32.** A supervised person must keep its risk assessment for each customer that has still to be remediated in line with [section 4.7.2](04-identification-measures.md#472-timing-for-existing-customers) of this Handbook for a period of five years after the end of the calendar year in which it is superseded.


#### 10.4.3 On-going monitoring

!!! info "Guidance"

    **33.** A supervised person may demonstrate that it has kept details of the results of analysis undertaken regarding a business relationship or any transaction where it keeps adequate and orderly records containing the findings of its examination of notable transactions and activity, i.e., those that:

    - are inconsistent with the supervised person's knowledge of the customer;
    - are complex or unusually large;
    - form part of an unusual pattern; or

    - a copy of the form and supporting documentation used to make any internal SAR for that customer;
    - enquiries made in relation to that internal SAR and the decision of the MLRO (or Deputy MLRO ) to make or not make an external SAR;

    for a period of five years from the date that a business relationship ends, or if in relation to a one-off transaction, for five years from the date that a transaction was completed.


!!! info "Guidance"

    **37.** Depending on the volume of external SARs submitted, complexity of the supervised person and/or complexity of the matter subject to an external SAR, it may be decided to record continuation reports in a separate register to the initial external SAR. Where this is done, the supervised person should ensure that each continuation report is clearly linked to its initial external SAR.


#### 10.4.5 Screening, awareness and training of employees

!!! warning "AML/CFT/CPF Code of Practice"

    **38.** A supervised person must keep adequate and orderly records of training provided on the prevention and detection of money laundering, the financing of terrorism, or the financing of proliferation for five years after the end of the calendar year in which the training was provided, including:

    - names of Employees who received the training; and
    - records of testing subsequently carried out to measure E mployees' understanding of the training provided, including pass rates and details of any action taken in cases of failure.


### 10.5 Access and retrieval of records

**39.** The Money Laundering Order does not specify where records should be kept, but the overriding objective is for supervised persons to be able to access and retrieve relevant information without unreasonable delay.

!!! warning "AML/CFT/CPF Code of Practice"

    **40.** A supervised person must keep documents, data or information obtained under identification measures in a way that facilitates on-going monitoring of each business relationship.

    **41.** For all other purposes, the records kept by a supervised person must be readily accessible and retrievable by the person. Unless otherwise specified, records relating to evidence of identity, other CDD measures, and transactions must be accessible and retrievable within 5 working days (whether kept in or outside of Jersey), or such longer period as agreed with the JFSC. Other records must be accessible and retrievable within 10 working days (whether kept in or outside of Jersey), or such longer period as agreed with the JFSC.

    **42.** A supervised person must periodically review the condition of paper and electronic records and consider the adequacy of its record-keeping arrangements.

    **43.** A supervised person must periodically test procedures regarding access to and retrieval of its records.

    **44.** Records must be maintained in a readable format. Where records are kept other than in readable form, they must be maintained such that they can be produced in readable form at a computer terminal in Jersey.

    **45.** When original documents (such as transaction-related vouchers used to input data onto computer systems) that would ordinarily have been destroyed are requested for investigation purposes, a supervised person must ascertain whether the documents have in fact been destroyed.


#### 10.5.1 External record-keeping

**46.** Where records are kept by another person (group or otherwise), or kept outside Jersey, such as under an outsourcing or storage arrangement, this will present additional factors for a supervised person to consider. Regardless of the circumstances, the supervised person remains responsible for compliance with all record-keeping requirements.

**47.** Where an obliged person ceases to trade or have a relationship with a customer for whom it has provided an assurance to a supervised person, particular care needs to be taken to check whether the assurance continues to have effect, or to ensure that evidence of identity is obtained from the obliged person. [Section 5](05-reliance-obliged-persons.md) of this Handbook deals with reliance arrangements made with obliged persons.

!!! warning "AML/CFT/CPF Code of Practice"

    **48.** A supervised person must not:

    - allow another person (group or otherwise) to keep records; or
    - keep records outside Jersey;

    - where access and retrieval of records (by that person, the JFSC and/or law enforcement) is likely to be impeded by confidentiality or data protection restrictions.


#### 10.5.2 Reorganisation or termination

**49.** Record-keeping requirements persist and are unaffected where a supervised person:

- merges with another person;
- continues as another person;

- is taken over by another person;
- is subject to internal reorganisation;
- terminates its activities; or
- transfers a block of customers (i.e., a 'book of business') to another person.

!!! warning "AML/CFT/CPF Code of Practice"

    **50.** A supervised person that undergoes mergers, continuance, takeovers or internal reorganisations, must ensure that records remain readily accessible and retrievable for the required periods stated above. This extends to the rationalising of computer systems and storage arrangements.

    **51.** Record-keeping arrangements must be agreed with the JFSC where a supervised person terminates its activities or transfers a block of customers to another person.


### 10.6 Disclosure of records

**52.** The FATF Recommendations identify several cases where a financial institution (or a DNFBP ) may provide an assurance to another that it will provide documents, data or information:

- FATF Recommendation 13 provides that a respondent institution (in the context of a correspondent banking relationship ) should be able to provide relevant customer identification data upon request to the correspondent financial institution;
- FATF Recommendation 17 provides that a financial institution relying upon another party should be required to take adequate steps to be satisfied that relevant documentation relating to CDD requirements will be made available by that party upon request and without delay.

**53.** Accordingly, it is important that where the respondent institution or party relied upon is a supervised person in Jersey, there should be no legal impediment to providing the data and information requested.

!!! danger "Statutory Requirement"

    **54.** Article 16(7) of the Money Laundering Order states that, where a relevant person (including a person who was formerly a relevant person) (A) has given an assurance under Article 16 of the Money Laundering Order (or under a provision that applies outside Jersey that is equivalent to Article 16 of the Money Laundering Order) to another relevant person (B), Person A must make available to Person B, at Person B's request, evidence of identity that Person A has obtained under Article 3 of the Money Laundering Order. Person A commits an offence under the Proceeds of Crime Law where it fails do so.

    **55.** Article 17C(4) of the Money Laundering Order states that, where a relevant person (A) has given an assurance under Article 17C(2)(b) of the Money Laundering Order (or under a provision that applies outside Jersey that is equivalent to Article 17C of the Money Laundering Order) to another person (B), Person A may make available to Person B, at Person B's request, information and evidence of identity that Person A has obtained under Article 3 of the Money Laundering Order. However, A is not required by law to do so.

    56. Article 19(7) of the Money Laundering Order applies to a relevant person carrying on deposittaking business (a respondent) who is in receipt of banking services provided by an institution whose address is outside Jersey (a correspondent). It allows the respondent to provide the correspondent with evidence, documents, data and information obtained under Article 3 of the Money Laundering Order on request. However, the respondent is not required by law to provide information to the correspondent.
