# Section 2 - Corporate Governance

**1.** Corporate governance is the system by which enterprises are directed and controlled and their risks managed. For supervised persons, money laundering, the financing of terrorism, and the financing of proliferation are risks that must be managed in the same way as other business risks.

**2.** Under the general heading of corporate governance, this section considers:

- board responsibilities for the prevention and detection of money laundering, the countering of terrorist financing, and the countering of proliferation financing;
- requirements for systems and controls, training, and awareness;
- the appointment of a MLCO and MLRO.

**3.** This Handbook describes a supervised person's general framework to combat money laundering, the financing of terrorism, and the financing of proliferation as its systems and controls. The Handbook refers to the way in which those systems and controls are implemented into the dayto-day operation of a supervised person as its policies and procedures.

**4.** Where a supervised person is not a company but is, for example, a partnership, references in this section to 'the board' should be read as meaning the senior management of that person, including the board of a legal arrangement's Governing body. In the case of a sole trader, 'the board' will be the sole trader. In the case of an overseas company carrying on a supervised business in Jersey through a branch, 'the board' should be read as including the local management function of that branch in Jersey.

**5.** Section 18 of this Handbook details how a supervised person who meets certain criteria to appoint an AMLSP may fulfil its obligations.

### 2.2 AML/CFT/CPF measures

!!! danger "Statutory Requirement"

    **6.** In accordance with Article 37 of the Proceeds of Crime Law, a relevant person must take prescribed measures to prevent and detect money laundering and the financing of terrorism. Failure to take such measures is a criminal offence and, where such an offence is proved to have been committed with the consent or connivance of, or to be attributable to neglect on the part of, a director or manager or officer of the relevant person, they too shall be deemed to have committed a criminal offence.

    **7.** Article 37 enables the Minister for External Relations and Financial Services to prescribe by Order the measures that must be taken (including measures not to be taken)

    - (i) by a relevant person; and
    - (ii) by an AMLSP appointed by a relevant person.

    These measures are established in the Money Laundering Order.

    These measures are established in the

    Money laundering

    Order.


### 2.3 Board responsibilities

**8.** The key responsibilities of the board, set out in further detail below, are to:

- identify the supervised person's money laundering, the financing of terrorism, and the financing of proliferation risks;
- ensure that its systems and controls are appropriately designed and implemented to manage those risks; and
- ensure that sufficient resources are devoted to fulfilling these responsibilities.

**9.** The board is assisted in fulfilling these responsibilities by a MLCO and MLRO. Larger or more complex supervised persons may also require dedicated risk and internal audit functions to assist in the assessment and management of money laundering, the financing of terrorism, and the financing of proliferation risk.

!!! danger "Statutory Requirement"

    **10.** Article 11(1) of the Money Laundering Order requires a relevant person to establish and maintain appropriate and consistent policies and procedures in respect of the person's financial services business, and financial services business carried on by a subsidiary, to prevent and detect money laundering and the financing of terrorism.

    **11.** Article 11(11) of the Money Laundering Order requires a relevant person to establish and maintain adequate procedures for monitoring compliance with and testing the effectiveness of: (i) its policies and procedures; (ii) its measures to promote AML/CFT/CPF awareness; and (iii) its training of relevant employees (see Section 9 of this Handbook).

    **12.** Articles 7 and 8 of the Money Laundering Order require that a relevant person appoints a MLCO and a MLRO.


!!! warning "AML/CFT/CPF Code of Practice"

    **13.** The board must conduct and record a BRA in respect of the supervised person. In particular, the board must consider, on an on-going basis, the supervised person's risk appetite and the extent of the supervised person's exposure to money laundering, the financing of terrorism, and the financing of proliferation risks 'in the round' or as a whole by reference to the supervised person's organisational structure, customers, the countries and territories with which those customers are connected, the products and services the supervised person provides and how those products and services are delivered. The assessment must consider the cumulative effect of risks identified, which may exceed the sum of each individual risk element. The board's assessment must be kept up -todate (see section 2.3.1 of this Handbook ).

    **14.** Based on its BRA, the board must establish a formal strategy to counter money laundering, the financing of terrorism, and the financing of proliferation. Where a supervised person forms part of a group operating outside the Island, that strategy may protect both its global reputation and its Jersey business.

    **15.** Considering the conclusions of the BRA and strategy, the board must:

    - organise and control its affairs in a way that effectively mitigates the risks that it has identified, including areas that are complex; and

    - be able to demonstrate the existence of adequate and effective systems and controls (including policies and procedures ) to counter money laundering, the financing of terrorism, and the financing of proliferation (see Section 2.4 of this Handbook ).

    **16.** The board must document its systems and controls (including policies and procedures ) and clearly apportion responsibilities for countering money laundering, the financing of terrorism, or the financing of proliferation, and, in particular, responsibilities of the MLCO and MLRO (see sections 2.5 and 2.6 of this Handbook ).

    **17.** The board must assess both the effectiveness of, and compliance with, systems and controls (including policies and procedures ) and take prompt action necessary to address any deficiencies (see sections 2.4.1 and 2.4.2 of this Handbook ).

    **18.** The board must consider what barriers (including cultural barriers) exist to prevent the operation of effective systems and controls (including policies and procedures ) to counter money laundering, the financing of terrorism, or the financing of proliferation, and must take effective measures to address them (see section 2.4.3 of this Handbook ).

    **19.** The board must notify the JFSC immediately in writing of any material failures to comply with the requirements of the Money Laundering Order or the AML/CFT/CPF Handbook.


#### 2.3.1 BRA

!!! warning "AML/CFT/CPF Code of Practice"

    **20.** A supervised person must maintain appropriate policies and procedures to enable it, when requested by the JFSC, to make available to that authority a copy of its BRA.


!!! info "Guidance"

    **21.** When considering a risk appetite for the supervised person's business, the board may wish to examine the following factors (note the below list is not exhaustive):

    - are they prepared to accept only a certain proportion of business rated at each risk level? For example, the board may only have an appetite for high-risk customers to form a set proportion of their overall fee income or assets under management;
    - are there any country connections or customer risk levels with which the board are not prepared to engage?
    - are there any sensitive activities or industries undertaken by potential customers, which the board are not prepared to take on?
    - will the board accept business relationships or one-off transactions where PEPs are involved?
    - how do the characteristics of the supervised person (e.g., business sector, type of products and services offered) potentially expose it to greater ML, TF, and/or PF risk?
    - what types of customers and activity are considered to be outside of Jersey's national risk appetite? See Financial crime strategy, appetite and national risk assessments (gov.je)

    **22.** It is important for the risk appetite to be sufficiently clear so that the board can articulate it when considering whether to establish a business relationship or carry out a one-off transaction with a customer. For example, it should not be so vague that it can be used to justify the acceptance of any business, no matter the risk level.

    **23.** Equally, a clear risk appetite should not be wilfully ignored. For example, a high-risk potential customer offers an attractive fee proposition, so the business is accepted even though doing so would mean the supervised person exceeds the risk appetite's stated maximum proportion of high -risk business.

    **24.** It is the responsibility of the board to ensure that business relationships and one-off transactions are maintained in accordance with the agreed risk appetite.

    **25.** A supervised person may extend its existing risk management systems to address money laundering/terrorist financing/proliferation financing risks. The detail and sophistication of these systems will depend on the supervised person's size and the complexity of the business it undertakes. Ways of incorporating a supervised person's BRA will be governed by the size of the supervised person and how regularly compliance staff and the board are involved in day-to-day activities.

    **26.** The board of a supervised person may demonstrate that it has considered its exposure to money laundering, the financing of terrorism, and the financing of proliferation risk by:

    - involving all members of the board in determining the risks posed by money laundering, the financing of terrorism, and the financing of proliferation within those areas for which they have responsibility;
    - considering organisational factors that may increase the level of exposure to the risk of money laundering, the financing of terrorism, and the financing of proliferation, e.g., outsourced aspects of regulated activities or compliance functions;
    - considering the nature, scale and complexity of its business, the diversity of its operations (including geographical diversity), the volume and size of its transactions, and the degree of risk associated with each area of its operation;
    - considering who its customers are and what they do, e.g., do its customers engage in higher-risk activities (having regard for the JFSC 's Sound Business Policy);
    - considering whether any additional risks are posed by the countries, territories and areas with which its customers are connected. Factors such as high levels of organised crime, increased vulnerabilities to corruption and inadequate frameworks to prevent and detect money laundering, the financing of terrorism, and the financing of proliferation will impact the risk posed by relationships connected with such countries, territories and areas;
    - considering the characteristics of the products and services that it offers and assessing the associated vulnerabilities posed by each product and service. For example:
    - (a) products that allow a customer to 'pool' third party funds will tend to be more vulnerable - because of the anonymity provided by the co-mingling of assets or funds belonging to several third parties by the customer;
    - (b) products such as standard current accounts are more vulnerable because they allow payments to be made to and from external parties, including cash transactions;
    - (c) conversely, those products that do not permit external party transfers or where redemption is permitted only to an account from which the investment is funded will be less vulnerable;
    - (d) products and services which make use of new and developing technologies, such as virtual assets, may pose a risk due to the increased anonymity which can be afforded by the asset to their users. There may also be a lack of experience in providing these new products, meaning the control environment may not be as effective.

    - considering the risk that is involved in placing reliance on obliged persons to apply reliance identification measures;
    - considering how it establishes and delivers products and services to its customers. For example, risks are likely to be greater where relationships may be established remotely (non-face-to-face), or may be controlled remotely by the customer (straight-through processing of transactions);
    - a supervised person may employ new and developing technologies to establish business relationships with their customers, for example through an E-ID application. As discussed further in Section 4.3.5 of this Handbook, the risks of using such technology to obtain evidence of identity should be considered, noting the particular characteristics of each application. This should be recorded in the BRA;
    - considering the accumulation of risk for more complex customers.

    **27.** When conducting a BRA care should be taken not to focus too much on any single factor. All factors (including those identified by a National Risk Assessment or similar), as well as the wider picture (and cumulative risk) should be considered.

    **28.** Care should also be taken not to rely on a 'template' BRA, i.e., one previously prepared within the business or supplied by an external provider. The assessment should be customised to fully reflect and consider the unique types of customers serviced by the business, the geographical areas to which it has exposure, and the specific products and services provided by the business.

    **29.** With reference to new and developing technologies, the board should have a due diligence process in place to analyse and understand their risks, then apply a framework for how they will be monitored and managed going forward.

    **30.** A generic example of how risk might be calculated in a BRA is set out below. Please note this methodology is for illustrational purposes only. It should not be construed as the JFSC taking a position on how risk should be calculated and represented in a BRA. Each BRA should uniquely consider and represent the risks and controls identified by the supervised person:


| Impact (implications of event) | Likelihood (of event happening) | Inherent Risk (impact x likelihood) | Impact and likelihood after controls applied | Residual risk (impact x likelihood after controls applied) |
|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| 3 - Significant impact on business. | 3 - Very likely. | 9 - High inherent risk. | Each rating may range from 1-3. | Possible scores: 1-9. |
| 2 - Moderate impact on business. | 2 - Moderately likely. | 4 - Moderate inherent risk. | Each rating may range from 1-3. | Possible scores: 1-9. |
| 1 - Minimal impact on business. | 1 - Unlikely to happen. | 1 - Low inherent risk. | Each rating may range from 1-3. | Possible scores: 1-9. |

    **31.** A generic example of a BRA is set out below. Please note the descriptions and scores assigned to these risks are for illustrational purposes only. They should not be construed as the JFSC taking a position on how these risks should be scored and/or controlled. Each BRA should uniquely consider and represent the risks and controls identified by the supervised person:


| Risk descriptor | Impact | Likelihood | Inherent Risk | Controls applied | Residual Risk |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|
| Customer is involved in evasion of sanctions relating to financing of proliferation. | 3 (Reputational damage, potential legal/regulatory sanctions). | 2 | 6 | Business will not engage with customers involved in shipping or have connections to Iran or DPRK. Reduces likelihood to 1. | 3 x 1 = 3 |
| Pandemic requiring national lockdown. | 3 (Business unable to operate). | 1 | 3 | All staff able to work remotely. All customer transactions can be undertaken electronically. Reduces impact to 1. | 1 x 1 = 1 |
| Breach of Money Laundering Order. | 3 (Reputational damage, potential legal/regulatory sanctions). | 2 | 6 | Staff receive training at on- boarding, and regularly thereafter. Staff are required to comply with policies and procedures. Breaches are recorded and considered at board meetings. Consideration includes trends analysis, lessons learned, training needs and strengthening controls. Reduces likelihood to 1. | 3 x 1 = 3 |

!!! info "Guidance"

    **32.** In developing a risk-based approach, supervised persons need to ensure that the BRA can be understood by the board, other relevant employees and relevant third parties, e.g., auditors and the JFSC.

    **33.** In the case of a supervised person that is dynamic and growing, the board may demonstrate that its BRA is kept up-to-date where it is reviewed annually. In some other cases, this may be too often, e.g., a supervised person with a stable customer base, products, and services. In all cases, the board may demonstrate that its BRA is kept up-to-date where it is reviewed when events (internal and external) occur that may materially change money laundering, terrorist financing, and proliferation financing risk.

    **34.** It may be beneficial for money laundering, financing of terrorism, and financing of proliferation risks and controls to each be considered separately.

    **35.** When reviewing a BRA, the board should ensure it captures all relevant risks and considers how effective the business' control environment is at managing those risks. Effectiveness can be evidenced by considering the findings of control testing such as periodic reviews and reviewing data collected by the supervised person.

    **36.** Where gaps or deficiencies are identified during a BRA review, an action plan should be drawn up so they can be addressed. The action plan should form an integral part of the BRA.

    **37.** Where a supervised person is subject to a regulatory Code of Practice (such as the Trust Company Business Code of Practice) there is also an obligation for a wider, operational BRA to be conducted. When preparing an AML/CFT/CPF BRA or CRA, factors in this operational BRA may be relevant. Therefore, a combined AML/CFT/CPF and operational BRA may be appropriate.

    **38.** Risks that are not normally considered to be specific money laundering/terrorist financing/proliferation financing risks may also be relevant to an AML/CFT/CPF BRA, for example, credit risk, tax risk, investor eligibility risk, cyber security related risk etc.

    **39.** It is likely that the BRA will be conducted by the supervised person prior to any CRA. When a CRA is prepared, the BRA may need to be updated (for example, to consider new risk factors, or the supervised person's changing risk tolerance/appetite).

    **40.** For supervised persons who are operating as an agent of another supervised person (or have agents operating on their behalf), either the supervised person or the agent should determine, relative to the nature of their relationship, how each risk is to be identified, managed, and documented. This is particularly important in the case of MVTS supervised persons, whereby each agent may have bespoke risks which will need to be carefully identified, assessed, and managed.


### 2.4 Adequate and effective systems and controls

**41.** For systems and controls (including policies and procedures ) to be adequate and effective in preventing and detecting money laundering, the financing of terrorism, the financing of proliferation, they will need to be appropriate to the circumstances of the supervised person. See Section 18 of this Handbook where an AMLSP appointed by a supervised person may provide AMLSP services relating to systems and controls.

!!! danger "Statutory Requirement"

    **42.** Article 11(1) of the Money Laundering Order requires a relevant person to establish and maintain appropriate and consistent policies and procedures in respect of the person's financial services business, and financial services business carried on by a subsidiary, to prevent and detect money laundering, the financing of terrorism.

    **43.** Parts 3, 3A, 4 and 5 of the Money Laundering Order set out the measures that are to be applied in respect of CDD, record-keeping and reporting.

    **44.** Article 11(2) of the Money Laundering Order requires that policies and procedures established and maintained under Article 11(1) are appropriate and consistent having regard to the degree of risk of money laundering and the financing of terrorism taking into account: (i) the level of risk identified in a national or sector-specific risk assessment in relation to money laundering carried out in respect of Jersey; and (ii) the type of customers, business relationships, products and transactions with which the relevant person's business is concerned.

    **45.** Article 11(3) lists several policies and procedures that must be established and maintained.

    **46.** Article 11(9) of the Money Laundering Order requires a relevant person to take appropriate measures for the purpose of making employees whose duties relate to the provision of financial services ('relevant employees') aware of policies and procedures under Article 11(1) and of legislation in Jersey to counter money laundering and the financing of terrorism. Article 11(10) of the Money Laundering Order requires a relevant person to provide relevant employees with training in the recognition and handling of transactions carried out by or on behalf of persons who are, or appear to be, engaged in money laundering or the financing of terrorism.

    **47.** Article 11(11) of the Money Laundering Order requires a relevant person to establish and maintain policies and procedures for monitoring compliance with and testing the effectiveness of: (i) its policies and procedures; (ii) its measures to promote AML/CFT awareness; and (iii) its training of relevant employees (see Section 9 of this Handbook).

    **48.** When considering the type and extent of testing to be carried out under Articles 11(11) and 11(12) of the Money Laundering Order requires a relevant person to have regard to the risk of money laundering or financing of terrorism that exists in respect of the relevant person's business, and matters that have an impact on that risk, such as the size and structure of the relevant person.

    **49.** Article 11(8) requires that a relevant person operating through branches or subsidiaries, which carry on financial services business, must communicate its policies and procedures, maintained in accordance with Article 11(1) of the Money Laundering Order, to those branches or subsidiaries. In addition, Article 11A of the Money Laundering Order requires group programmes for information sharing (see Section 2.8 of this Handbook).


!!! warning "AML/CFT/CPF Code of Practice"

    **50.** A supervised person must establish and maintain appropriate and consistent systems and controls to prevent and detect money laundering, the financing of terrorism, and the financing of proliferation, that enable it to:

    - apply the policies and procedures referred to in Article 11 of the Money Laundering Order;
    - apply CDD measures -in line with Sections 3 to 7 of this Handbook;
    - report to the FIU when it knows, suspects, or has reasonable grounds to know or suspect that another person is involved in money laundering or the financing of terrorism, including attempted transactions -in line with Section 8 of this Handbook;

    - adequately screen relevant employees when they are initially employed, make employees aware of certain matters and provide training -in line with Section 9 of this Handbook;
    - keep complete records that may be accessed on a timely basis -in line with Section 10 of this Handbook;
    - liaise closely with the JFSC and the FIU on matters concerning vigilance, systems, and controls (including policies and procedures );
    - communicate policies and procedures to overseas branches and subsidiaries (subject to Article 10A(9) of the Money Laundering Order (see section 1.4.2 of this Handbook ), and monitor compliance therewith; and
    - monitor and review instances where exemptions are granted to policies and procedures, or where controls are overridden.

    **51.** In addition to those listed in Article 11(3) of the Money Laundering Order, a supervised person must have policies and procedures for:

    - customer acceptance (and rejection), including approval levels for higher risk customers;
    - the use of transaction limits and management approval for higher risk customers;
    - placing reliance on obliged persons;
    - applying exemptions from CDD requirements under Part 3A of the Money Laundering Order and enhanced CDD measures under Articles 15, and 15A of the Money Laundering Order;
    - keeping documents, data or information obtained under identification measures up-to-date and relevant changes in beneficial ownership and/or control, including beneficiaries under a life insurance policy;
    - taking action in response to notices highlighting countries and territories in relation to which the FATF has called for the application of countermeasures or enhanced CDD measures;
    - taking action to comply with the Targeted Financial Sanctions Measures and the Directions Law.

    **52.** A supervised person must check that the systems and controls (including policies and procedures ) are operating effectively and test that they are complied with.


#### 2.4.1 Effectiveness of systems and controls

!!! info "Guidance"

    **53.** A supervised person may demonstrate that it checks that systems and controls (including policies and procedures ) are adequate and operating effectively where the Board periodically considers the efficacy (capacity to have the desired outcome) of those systems and controls (including policies and procedures, and those in place at branches and in respect of subsidiaries) considering:

    - changes to its business activities or BRA;
    - information published from time to time by the JFSC or FIU, e.g., findings of supervisory and themed examinations and typologies;

    - changes made or proposed in respect of new legislation, AML/CFT/CPF Codes of Practice issued under the Supervisory Bodies Law or Guidance;
    - resources available to comply with the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Legislation and AML/CFT/CPF Codes of Practice issued under the Supervisory Bodies Law, in particular resources provided to the MLCO and MLRO, to apply enhanced CDD measures and to scrutinise transactions.

    **54.** A supervised person may demonstrate that it checks that systems and controls (including policies and procedures ) are operating effectively where the board periodically considers the effect of those systems and controls (including policies and procedures, and those in place at branches and in respect of subsidiaries) considering the information that is available to it, including:

    - reports presented by the MLCO and others (e.g., where appropriate, risk management and internal audit functions) on compliance matters and MLRO on reporting;
    - reports summarising findings from supervisory and themed examinations and action taken or being taken to address recommendations;
    - the number and percentage of customers that have been assessed by the supervised person as presenting a higher risk;
    - the number of applications to establish business relationships or carry-out one-off transactions which have been declined due to CDD issues, along with reasons;
    - the number of business relationships terminated due to CDD issues, along with reasons;
    - the number of 'existing customers ' that have still to be remediated under Section 4.7.2 of this Handbook;
    - details of failures by an obliged person or customer to provide information and evidence on demand and without delay under Articles 16, 16A and 17B-D of the Money Laundering Order, and action taken;
    - the number of alerts generated by automated on-going monitoring systems;
    - the number of internal SARs made to the MLRO (or Deputy MLRO ), the number of subsequent external SARs submitted to the FIU, and timeliness of reporting (by business area if appropriate);
    - inquiries made by the FIU, or production orders received, without issues having previously been identified by CDD or reporting policies and procedures, along with reasons;
    - results of testing of awareness of relevant employees with policies and procedures and legislation;
    - the number and scope of exemptions granted to policies and procedures, including at branches and subsidiaries, along with reasons.

    **55.** The level of systems and controls, and the extent to which monitoring needs to take place will be affected by:

    - the supervised person's size;
    - the nature, scale and complexity of its operations;
    - the number of different business types it is involved in;
    - the types of services it offers and how it delivers those services;
    - the type of business transactions it becomes involved in or advises on;

    - its overall risk profile.

    **56.** Areas which are required under the Money Laundering Order to be covered in systems and controls include (but are not limited to):

    - the manner in which disclosures are to be made to the MLRO;
    - the circumstances in which delayed CDD is permitted;
    - when outsourcing of CDD obligations or reliance on third parties will be permitted, and on what conditions;
    - CDD requirements to be met for simplified, standard and enhanced due diligence;
    - how the supervised person will restrict work being conducted for a customer where CDD has not been completed.

    **57.** Issues which may also be covered in systems and controls include:

    - the level of personnel permitted to exercise discretion on the risk-based application of the Money Laundering Order and this Handbook, and under what circumstances;
    - when cash payments will be accepted;
    - when payments will be accepted from or made to third parties;

    - the supervised person's policy for applying LPP. Note that LPP is only applicable to Lawyers -see Section 15.7.1 of this Handbook.
    **58.** For supervised persons with an agent relationship with another natural or legal person, it is the responsibility of the supervised person to ensure that they have sufficient oversight or understanding of the operations of the agent to be able to demonstrate adequate systems and controls in relation to this relationship.


#### 2.4.2 Testing of compliance with systems and controls

!!! info "Guidance"

    **59.** A supervised person may demonstrate that it has tested compliance with systems and controls (including policies and procedures ) where the board periodically considers the means by which compliance with its systems and controls (including policies and procedures ) has been monitored, compliance deficiencies identified, and details of action taken or proposed to address any such deficiencies.

    **60.** A supervised person may demonstrate that it has tested compliance with systems and controls (including policies and procedures ) where testing covers all the policies and procedures maintained in line with Article 11(1) of the Money Laundering Order and the AML/CFT/CPF Codes of Practice, in particular:

    - the application of simplified and enhanced CDD measures;
    - reliance placed on obliged persons under Article 16 of the Money Laundering Order;
    - action taken in response to notices highlighting countries and territories in relation to which the FATF has called for the application of countermeasures or enhanced CDD measures;
    - action taken to comply with the Targeted Financial Sanctions Measures and the Directions Law; and

    - the number or type of employees who have received training, the methods of training and the nature of any significant issues arising from the training.


#### 2.4.3 Consideration of cultural barriers

**61.** The implementation of systems and controls (including policies and procedures ) for the prevention and detection of money laundering, the countering of terrorist financing, and the countering of proliferation financing does not remove the need for a supervised person to address cultural barriers that can prevent effective control. Human factors, such as the inter-relationships between different employees, and between employees and customers, can result in the creation of damaging barriers.

**62.** Unlike systems and controls (including policies and procedures ), the prevailing culture of an organisation is intangible. As a result, its impact on a supervised person can sometimes be difficult to measure.

!!! info "Guidance"

    **63.** A supervised person may demonstrate that it has considered whether cultural barriers might hinder the effective operation of systems and controls (including policies and procedures ) to prevent and detect money laundering, counter terrorist financing, and counter proliferation financing where the board considers the prevalence of the following factors:

    - an unwillingness on the part of employees to subject high value (and therefore important) customers to effective CDD measures for commercial reasons;
    - pressure applied by management or customer relationship managers outside Jersey upon employees in Jersey to transact without first conducting all relevant CDD;
    - undue influence exerted by relatively large customers in order to circumvent CDD measures;
    - excessive pressure applied on employees to meet aggressive revenue-based targets, or where employee or management remuneration or bonus schemes are exclusively linked to revenue-based targets;
    - an excessive desire on the part of employees to provide a confidential and efficient customer service;
    - design of the customer risk classification system in a way that avoids rating any customer as presenting a higher risk;
    - the inability of employees to understand the commercial rationale for business relationships, resulting in a failure to identify non-commercial and therefore potential money laundering, terrorist financing, or proliferation financing activity;
    - negative handling by managerial staff of queries raised by more junior employees regarding unusual, complex or higher risk activity and transactions;
    - an assumption on the part of more junior employees that their concerns or suspicions are of no consequence;
    - a tendency for line managers to discourage employees from raising concerns due to lack of time and/or resources, preventing any such concerns from being addressed satisfactorily;

    - dismissal of information concerning allegations of criminal activities on the grounds that the customer has not been successfully prosecuted or lack of public information to verify the veracity of allegations;
    - the familiarity of employees with certain customers resulting in unusual or higher risk activity and transactions within such relationships not being identified as such;
    - little weight or significance is attributed to the role of the MLCO or MLRO, and little cooperation between these post-holders and customer -facing employees;
    - actual practices applied by employees do not align with policies and procedures;
    - employee feedback on problems encountered applying policies and procedures is ignored;
    - non-attendance of senior employees at training sessions, e.g. based on a mistaken belief that they cannot learn anything new or because they have too many other competing demands on their time.


#### 2.4.4 Outsourcing

**64.** In a case where a supervised person outsources a particular activity, it bears the ultimate responsibility for the duties undertaken in its name. This will include the requirement to determine that the external party has in place satisfactory systems and controls (including policies and procedures ), and that those systems and controls (including policies and procedures ) are kept up-todate to reflect changes in requirements. See the table below for details of which CDD activities may be outsourced.

| CDD (always the ultimate responsibility of the supervised person ) | Activities which may be outsourced | Activities which may be outsourced |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Identification measures | Risk assessment. | Risk assessment. |
| Identification measures | Identification of customer. | Identification of customer. |

**65.** Depending on the nature and size of a supervised person, the roles of the MLCO and MLRO may require additional support and resourcing. Where a supervised person elects to bring in additional support, or to delegate areas of the MLCO or MLRO functions to external parties, the MLCO or MLRO will remain directly responsible for their respective role, and the board will remain responsible for overall compliance with the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Legislation (and by extension, also this Handbook ). Note that the AML/CFT/CPF Codes of Practice at paragraphs 90 and 103 below provide that the role of the MLCO and MLRO must be undertaken by an employee of the supervised person based in Jersey, unless the specific circumstances set out in the sub-paragraphs to those specific codes of practice apply.

**66.** The JFSC has also issued an Outsourcing policy for supervised persons, which outlines its own set of requirements and obligations in respect of outsourcing.

**67.** Where an AMLSP performs AMLSP services on behalf of an AMLSP Direct Customer and such AMLSP services are consistent with the Money Laundering Order and the standards set out in the AML/CFT/CPF Codes of Practice and Guidance notes for AMLSPs in this Handbook, the performance of such AMLSP services is not subject to the Outsourcing policy but is subject to Section 18 of this Handbook.

!!! warning "AML/CFT/CPF Code of Practice"

    **68.** All supervised persons must comply with the JFSC 's Outsourcing policy e, except where an AMLSP performs AMLSP services on behalf of an AMLSP Direct Customer and such AMLSP services are consistent with the Money Laundering Order and the standards set out in the AML/CFT/CPF Codes of Practice and Guidance notes for AMLSPs in this Handbook.

    **69.** A supervised person must consider the effect that outsourcing has on money laundering, terrorist financing, and proliferation financing risk, in particular where an MLCO or MLRO is provided with additional support from other parties, either from within group or externally.

    **70.** A supervised person must assess possible money laundering, terrorist financing, and proliferation financing risk associated with outsourced functions, record its assessment, and monitor any risk on an on-going basis.

    **71.** Where an outsourced activity is a supervised business activity, then a supervised person must be satisfied that the provider of the outsourced services has in place policies and procedures that are consistent with those required under the Money Laundering Order and, by association, this Handbook.

    **72.** A supervised person must be satisfied that knowledge, suspicion, or reasonable grounds for knowledge or suspicion of money laundering, the financing of terrorism or proliferation financing activity will be reported by the provider of the outsourced service to the MLRO (or Deputy MLRO ) of the supervised person.


### 2.5 Risk Questionnaires

**73.** Since 2018, the JFSC has collected data from supervised persons on an annual basis to support our implementation of a risk-based approach to supervision. This includes:

- organisational/footprint data;
- AML/CFT/CPF compliance data; and
- data regarding a supervised person's customers.

**74.** This data is used to:

- improve our understanding of the activities undertaken by supervised persons and modify our risk-based approach; accordingly, and
- assist in the preparation of national risk assessments for Jersey.

**75.** To collect the above-referenced data, the JFSC will issue one or more Risk Questionnaires to supervised persons. The content of a Risk Questionnaire will differ based on the business sector of the supervised person. At the discretion of the JFSC, some sectors or parts thereof may not be included in a particular Risk Questionnaire exercise.

**76.** A set period will be provided, by the end of which all supervised persons receiving a Risk Questionnaire are required to complete and return it to the JFSC.

!!! warning "AML/CFT/CPF Code of Practice"

    **77.** When in receipt of a Risk Questionnaire from the JFSC, a supervised person must complete and return it by the deadline provided.


!!! info "Guidance"

    **78.** To prepare for a Risk Questionnaire, a supervised person may consider reviewing relevant Guidance notes issued by the JFSC in previous data collection exercises. The supervised person can then update its systems and controls (including policies and procedures ) so the required data is collected during the usual course of business.

    **79.** For each data collection exercise, the JFSC will provide specific guidance on how to complete the Risk Questionnaire. This includes guidance for the organisational/footprint part of the Risk Questionnaire and the sector-specific parts. A supervised person should read the relevant guidance in full before completing a Risk Questionnaire.

    **80.** A supervised person should consider storing the required data in a format which can be easily reviewed, extracted, and transferred to a Risk Questionnaire. It may also be appropriate to ensure any supporting documentation which was used in completing a Risk Questionnaire can be easily accessed, if required.

    **81.** Where a supervised person is unable to meet the deadline provided due to extenuating circumstances, a request should be made to that supervised persons supervisor as early as possible, seeking an extension.


### 2.6 The MLCO

**82.** The Money Laundering Order requires a supervised person or the supervised persons AMLSP, where applicable (see section 18 of this Handbook ), to appoint an individual as MLCO, and tasks that individual with the function of monitoring its compliance with legislation in Jersey relating to money laundering, the financing of terrorism, and the financing of proliferation and AML/CFT/CPF Codes of Practice issued under the Supervisory Bodies Law. The objective of this requirement is to require supervised persons to clearly demonstrate how they ensure compliance with the requirements of the same.

**83.** The Money Laundering Order also requires a supervised person to maintain adequate procedures for:

- (a) monitoring compliance with, and testing the effectiveness of, policies and procedures; and
- (b) monitoring and testing the effectiveness of measures to raise awareness and training. When considering the type and extent of compliance testing to be carried out, a supervised person shall have regard to the risk of money laundering, the financing of terrorism, and the financing of proliferation and matters that have an impact on risk, such as size and structure of the supervised person's business.

**84.** The MLCO may have a functional reporting line, e.g., to a group compliance function.

**85.** The Money Laundering Order does not rule out the possibility that the MLCO may also have other responsibilities. To the extent that the MLCO is also responsible for the development of systems and controls (and policies and procedures ), as well as monitoring subsequent compliance with those systems and controls (and policies and procedures ), some additional independent assessment of compliance will be needed from time to time to address this conflict of interest. Such an independent assessment is unlikely to be needed where the role of the MLCO is limited to actively monitoring the development and implementation of such systems and controls.

!!! danger "Statutory Requirement"

    **86.** Article 7 of the Money Laundering Order requires a relevant person or the relevant person ' s AMLSP, where applicable, to appoint a MLCO to monitor whether the enactments in Jersey relating to money laundering and the financing of terrorism and AML/CFT/CPF Codes of Practice are being complied with. The same person may be appointed as both MLCO and MLRO.

    **87.** Article 7(2A) of the Money Laundering Order requires a relevant person to ensure that the individual appointed is of an appropriate level of seniority and has timely access to all records that are necessary or expedient.

    **88.** Article 7(6) of the Money Laundering Order requires a relevant person to notify the JFSC in writing within one month when a person is appointed as, or ceases to be, a MLCO. However, Article 10 of the Money Laundering Order provides that the JFSC may grant exemptions from this notification requirement, by way of notice.

    **89.** Article 7 of the Money Laundering Order recognises that a relevant person that is also a regulated person may have notified the JFSC of the appointment or cessation of a MLCO under other legislation. If so, a duplicate notification is not required under the Money Laundering Order.


!!! warning "AML/CFT/CPF Code of Practice"

    **90.** A supervised person must appoint an MLCO that:

    - subject to Article 9A (Appointment of AMLSP to fulfil obligations of relevant person ) is employed by the supervised person or an enterprise in the same financial group as the supervised person;

    - is fully aware of both their and the supervised person's obligations under the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Legislation and AML/CFT/CPF Codes of Practice issued under the Supervisory Bodies Law.

    **92.** If the position of MLCO is expected to fall vacant, to comply with the statutory requirement to have an individual appointed to the office of MLCO at all times, a supervised person must take action to appoint a member of the board (or other appropriate member of senior management) to the position on a temporary basis.

    **93.** If temporary circumstances arise where the supervised person has a limited or inexperienced money laundering, terrorist financing, proliferation financing compliance resource, it must ensure that this resource is supported as necessary.

    **94.** When considering whether it is appropriate to appoint the same person as MLCO and MLRO, a supervised person must have regard to:

    - the respective demands of the two roles, taking into account the size and nature of the supervised person's activities; and
    - whether the individual will have sufficient time and resources to fulfil both roles effectively.


!!! info "Guidance"

    **95.** A supervised person may demonstrate that its MLCO is monitoring whether enactments and AML/CFT/CPF Codes of Practice issued under the Supervisory Bodies Law are being complied with where they:

    - respond promptly to requests for information made by the JFSC and the FIU.

    **96.** In a case where the MLCO is also responsible for the development of systems and controls (including policies and procedures ) in line with evolving requirements, a supervised person may demonstrate that the MLCO has appropriate independence where such systems and controls are subject to periodic independent scrutiny.


### 2.7 The MLRO

**97.** Whilst the Money Laundering Order requires one individual to be appointed as MLRO by the supervised person or the supervised persons AMLSP, where applicable (see section 18 of this Handbook ), it recognises that, given the size and complexity of operations of many enterprises, it may be appropriate to designate additional persons ( Deputy MLROs ) to whom SARs may be made.

!!! danger "Statutory Requirement"

    **98.** Article 8 of the Money Laundering Order requires a relevant person or the relevant person ' s AMLSP, where applicable, to appoint a MLRO.

### 2.8 Financial groups

**111.** A financial group of which a supervised person is a member must maintain a group programme for the sharing of AML/CFT/CPF information.

**112.** In addition, as explained in Section 1.4.3 of this Handbook, where a company incorporated in Jersey (a supervised person ) carries on a supervised business through an overseas branch, it must comply with AML/CFT/CPF Codes of Practice issued under the Supervisory Bodies Law in respect of that business, irrespective of whether it also carries on supervised business in or from within Jersey.

**113.** In practice, the above only applies to supervised persons that meet the definition of a financial group, this includes a requirement that a parent company or other legal person exercise control over every member of that group for the purposes of applying group supervision.

Group supervision refers to (a) the core principles for effective banking supervision published by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision; (b) the Objectives and Principles of Securities Regulation issued by the International Organisation of Securities Commissions; or (c) the Insurance Supervisory Principles issued by the International Association of Insurance Supervisors.
