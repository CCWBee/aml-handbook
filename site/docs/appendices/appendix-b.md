# Appendix B - Equivalent Countries and Territories

## Appendix B -Equivalent countries and territories

E

As set out in the AML/CFT/CPF Handbook we do not maintain a list of equivalent countries and territories.

Guidance on equivalent countries and territories and determining equivalence is set out in sections 1.9.2 and 1.9.3 of the AML/CFT/CPF Handbook respectively.

To assist supervised persons in their determination we have set out below links to potential sources of additional information which may be useful in determining equivalence. These are not intended to be exhaustive, nor are they placed in any order of priority. Independent research and judgement will be expected to cater for the requirements in the individual case.
